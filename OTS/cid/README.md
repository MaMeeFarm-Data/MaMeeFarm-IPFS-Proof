# CID Directory — DGCP Standard

This folder contains CID-related JSON files for DGCP proofs.

Purpose:
- Store content-addressed identifiers (CID metadata)
- Maintain separation between proof narratives and cryptographic references

Notes:
- Files may be relocated here from root or other directories
  as part of structural corrections.
- Such moves do NOT imply data modification or proof mutation.

All contents remain traceable and verifiable
under DGCP™ / MMFARM-POL License.
