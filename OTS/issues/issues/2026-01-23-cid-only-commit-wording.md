# Issue Log — 2026-01-23 (CID-only Commit Wording)

**Project:** MaMeeFarm™  
**Framework:** DGCP™ (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)  
**Date (Local):** 2026-01-23  
**Timezone:** Asia/Bangkok  
**Issue Type:** Documentation / Commit Message Consistency  
**Severity:** Informational (No Action Required)

---

## Summary

Minor wording inconsistency was observed in selected commit messages dated 2026-01-23, where the phrase **“daily proof”** appeared in commit messages for commits that contained **CID-only JSON records** without accompanying proof markdown files.

---

## Affected Records

- Proof 529  
- Proof 530  

(File contents, hashes, and OpenTimestamps evidence are correct and verified.)

---

## Assessment

- Cryptographic integrity (SHA-256) is intact  
- OpenTimestamps receipts were completed **prior to repository commit**  
- File structure and CID-only workflow are compliant with DGCP standards  
- No ambiguity exists at the data or evidence level  

The inconsistency is **semantic only** and does not affect verification, traceability, or governance validity.

---

## Decision

No corrective action required.

The commits are accepted as valid historical records.  
No history rewrite or amendment is performed, in accordance with DGCP principles.

---

## Governance Note

This issue log exists to document awareness and conscious acceptance of minor wording variance, reinforcing transparency without introducing retroactive modification.

---

## Status

Closed — Recorded for reference only.
