# Proof 383 — DGCP Daily Evidence

Date: 2025-12-24  
Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)

## Context
This file represents DGCP Proof 383,
part of MaMeeFarm™'s uninterrupted
daily proof-of-reality chain.

The proof records existence, continuity,
and data integrity through cryptographic
timestamping.

## Cryptographic Verification
- SHA256 (MD):
  1c42d0252091df5d9982bab092a97d03238d29bce3cb1d676559628019c25e40

## Method
- Hashing: SHA-256
- Timestamp: OpenTimestamps
- Verification: Completed
- Mutation: None

## Notes
This proof preserves the principle that
reality, once recorded and timestamped,
cannot be rewritten.
