# Proof 384 — DGCP Daily Evidence

Date: 2025-12-25  
Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)

## Context
This document represents Proof 384 in the
MaMeeFarm™ DGCP daily proof chain.

The proof records the existence of a real
file at a specific point in time and preserves
its integrity through cryptographic timestamping.

## Cryptographic Verification
- SHA256 (MD):
  970ff1e1ecbb38884c9d262dfb88f4ec30e36e56074b211532470486875e814

## Method
- Hash Algorithm: SHA-256
- Timestamp Service: OpenTimestamps
- Verification Status: Completed
- Post-Timestamp Modification: None

## Notes
This MD file serves as the human-readable
anchor of Proof 384.
JSON metadata will be issued separately
to complete the DGCP 2-file structure.
