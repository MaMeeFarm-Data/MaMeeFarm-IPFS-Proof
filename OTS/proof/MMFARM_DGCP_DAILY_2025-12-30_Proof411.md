## Context
This record is part of the MaMeeFarm™ DGCP daily archive.
The original media file referenced by this record was intentionally not retained.
Verification is performed using the SHA-256 hash and the OpenTimestamps (.ots) receipt.

---

## Description (Factual)
A daily proof entry was created for MaMeeFarm™ operations on 2025-12-30.

---

## Cryptographic Fingerprint
- **SHA-256:** 44298a3b747f2bcde73a2317c3b03fe4f549091a6fb706cc8cd50325edb81a06

---

## OpenTimestamps (OTS)
- An OpenTimestamps receipt file (**.ots**) was created for the SHA-256 hash above.
- **Verification note:** This proof can be verified by running OpenTimestamps verify using:
  - the recorded file hash (SHA-256) and
  - the corresponding **.ots** receipt stored by the operator.

---

## Significance
This entry preserves verifiable integrity of the daily proof via cryptographic hashing and timestamp anchoring.

---

## Activity Classification
- **Domain:** Farm Operations / Daily Logging
- **Data Type:** Proof Record (Text + Hash)
