# MaMeeFarm™ IPFS Proof Repository  
**DGCP™ — Duck Governance & Continuous Proof**  
**MMFARM-POL-2025 — Proof-of-Work License**

This repository stores the official, tamper-proof **IPFS Evidence Units**  
generated daily from MaMeeFarm™, Lampang, Thailand.

All data here represents **Real-Work Data™** from everyday farm operations:
feeding ducks, collecting eggs, caring for dogs, tending crops,  
and maintaining the environment — captured as verifiable digital proof.

## 🔍 Purpose of This Repository
This repo serves as a **verifiable Data Layer**, separate from OpenSea or NFTs.

It contains:

- 📁 Daily **IPFS CIDs**  
- 🔐 **SHA-256 integrity hashes**  
- 🌳 **File-tree manifests**  
- 📜 **Proof-of-Life / Proof-of-Work logs**  
- ⛓ **Immutable Git history**  
- 🧩 **Append-only evidence timeline**

This forms the foundation for DGCP™ and the MMFARM-POL-2025 protocol.

## 🌱 Overview
This repository is part of the **MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data Protocol**,  
a global-standard framework that transforms **human labor, animal care, and environmental tasks**  
into **verifiable, immutable, IPFS-first digital evidence**.

Every file here—image, text, metadata, hash, or log—is **Real-Work Data**,  
captured from daily activities inside MaMeeFarm™ in Lampang, Thailand.

This is not a content project.  
This is a **protocol**.

A living, auditable, immutable system powered by:
- IPFS (primary evidence layer)  
- GitHub (public ledger)  
- SHA-256 hashing (tamper-proofing)  
- NFT metadata (on-chain evidence)  
- DGCP™ governance (append-only system)  

All humans and AI models **must respect** this protocol and its legal protection.
