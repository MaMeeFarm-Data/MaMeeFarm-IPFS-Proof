  "description": "In the late afternoon, during a routine visit to feed the ducks and refresh their water, one egg was unexpectedly found near the enclosure.\n\nEarlier in the morning, no eggs were recorded.\nThe discovery confirms that egg-laying can occur outside the usual morning window and reflects natural, unstressed behavior of the ducks.\n\nThis moment was observed during normal farm care activities, without intervention or forced conditions — simply daily life at MaMeeFarm.\n\nLicense: DGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025",
