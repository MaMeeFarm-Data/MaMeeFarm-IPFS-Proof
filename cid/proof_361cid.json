  "name": "Proof 361 — Morning Walk to the Village (Approx. 3 km Round Trip)",
  "description": "This proof records a morning activity at MaMeeFarm on 20 December 2025 at 07:29 (GMT+7).\n\nThe image shows MaMee walking toward the village to purchase daily groceries. The estimated walking distance for this trip is approximately 3 kilometers round trip.\n\nThis activity represents routine, non-mechanized mobility within a rural environment and reflects daily self-sufficiency practices at MaMeeFarm. The walk occurs under clear morning conditions, prior to other farm tasks, and is recorded as-is with a visible timestamp to ensure temporal traceability.\n\nThis record contributes to the DGCP continuous proof system by documenting real-world human movement and daily logistics without automation or external intervention.\n\nLicense\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
