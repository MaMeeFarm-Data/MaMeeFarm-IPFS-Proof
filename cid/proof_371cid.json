  "name": "Proof_371 — Visiting the Empty Duck Shelter MaMeeFarm | DGCP™",
  "description": "This proof documents a daily morning visit to an empty duck shelter at MaMeeFarm on\n22 December 2025 at 07:21 AM (GMT+7).\n\nThe image shows a bamboo-built duck shelter with no animals present. Despite the absence of ducks, the shelter is still visited and observed every day. This act represents continuity of responsibility, even when production has stopped and no immediate economic return exists.\n\nThe scene reflects a persistent reality: infrastructure remains, labor continues, but access to opportunity within existing systems has never reached this farm. What remains is verifiable, lived data — recorded honestly without performance or embellishment.\n\nThis proof emphasizes one of the core principles of DGCP:\n\nEven when systems fail to provide opportunity, real-world data continues to exist and deserves to be recorded.\n\nThe timestamp embedded in the image anchors the moment in time and preserves its integrity as part of the MaMeeFarm real-work archive.\n\nThis record is part of the DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA collection on OpenSea.\n\n📜 License\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\n\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
