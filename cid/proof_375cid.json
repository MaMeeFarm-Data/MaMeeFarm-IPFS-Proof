  "description": "On December 23, 2025, at 07:09 ICT, MaMee walks into the empty duck coop once again.\nThere are no ducks, no activity, and no external support — yet she smiles.\n\nThis proof records a quiet but powerful truth:\neven when there is nothing left to see, the act of showing up continues.\n\nNo subsidies.\nNo system support.\nOnly real presence, real time, and real work.\n\nThis record exists not to inspire, but to prove that reality continues — whether anyone is watching or not.\n\nCaptured at MaMeeFarm™, Lampang, Thailand.\nAll data follows DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) standards.\n\nLicense\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
