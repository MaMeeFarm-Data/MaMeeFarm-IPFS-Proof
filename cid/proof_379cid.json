  "description": "This record captures the starting environmental condition of a working day at MaMeeFarm™.\n\nAt 07:10 (24 December 2025), ambient temperature and humidity were measured and visually recorded as part of the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) routine.\nThis data reflects the real physical state of the farm at the moment work begins before any activity alters the environment.\n\nSuch daily measurements form a continuous chain of ground-truth environmental data, anchoring agricultural reality to time, place, and observable conditions.\n\nThis NFT represents uninterrupted proof-of-reality, not a simulation, not a report\nbut a verifiable moment in time.\n\n🔹 License\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data archive.\nRedistribution or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
