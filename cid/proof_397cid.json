  "description": "This proof documents a pre-planting quality selection process at MaMeeFarm™.\n\nAt 11:18 on 27 December 2025, MaMee carefully sorted shallot bulbs in preparation for planting a new plot.\nBulbs showing signs of rot, dehydration, or weakness were identified and discarded, while healthy bulbs were retained for cultivation.\n\nThis activity records an essential agricultural decision-making step—quality control before planting—ensuring soil, labor, and resources are used efficiently.\nThe process is captured under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework as verifiable real-world work.\n\n🔹 License\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
