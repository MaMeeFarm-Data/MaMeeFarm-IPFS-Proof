  "description": "This proof documents a seed-saving and propagation activity at MaMeeFarm™.\n\nAt 11:23 on 27 December 2025, MaMee collected dried roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) seeds from mature plants to preserve and expand future cultivation.\nThe activity reflects intentional selection of local, self-produced seeds for reuse, supporting resilience, continuity, and independence in small-scale agriculture.\n\nThis record captures the moment where today’s harvest becomes tomorrow’s planting, preserved under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework as verifiable real-world agricultural work.\n\n🔹 License\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
