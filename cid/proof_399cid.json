  "description": "This proof documents the first operational action of the day at MaMeeFarm™ on 28 December 2025:\nan on-site environmental measurement recorded before any physical work began.\n\nThe image shows a temperature and humidity display mounted against a brick wall, capturing real-time field data directly from the farm environment.\nWeather conditions at the time of recording were clear sky and strong sunlight, indicating stable daytime conditions.\n\nThis record serves as a baseline environmental reference for the day’s activities, following the DGCP principle of capturing reality before intervention.\n\nLicense\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
