  "name": "DGCP | MaMeeFarm™ — Proof 400 Empty Duck Coop — Daily Reality Record",
  "description": "This proof records the continued absence of ducks inside the duck coop at MaMeeFarm™ on\n28 December 2025, 08:07 (local time).\n\nThe image documents the physical condition of the coop:\nempty ground, standing structure, and no living animals present.\nNo external support systems, institutional programs, or operational subsidies are involved in this moment.\n\nThis record exists to preserve unchanged reality, showing that the system remains closed,\nand that progress—if any—must begin from within, not from access granted by others.\n\nUnder DGCP principles, absence is also data, and emptiness is recorded with the same integrity as activity.\n\nLicense\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
