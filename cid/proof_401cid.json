  "name": "DGCP | MaMeeFarm™ — Proof 401 Dismantling the Duck Fence for Firewood",
  "description": "This proof documents the dismantling of the wooden fence that once enclosed the duck coop at MaMeeFarm™ on\n28 December 2025, 08:11 (local time).\n\nWith no ducks remaining, the fence no longer serves its original purpose.\nThe wooden poles are repurposed as firewood for cooking, sustaining both humans and dogs living on the farm.\n\nThis moment reflects adaptive survival under constraint:\nwhen livestock is gone, materials are reclaimed, and nothing is wasted.\n\nUnder DGCP principles, this is not loss—but resource transformation, recorded as lived reality without narrative embellishment.\n\nLicense\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
