  "name": "DGCP | MaMeeFarm™ — Proof 402 30 Baht Meal for Two: Daily Labor Evidence",
  "description": "This proof documents a daily survival meal prepared at MaMeeFarm™ on\n28 December 2025, 09:46 (local time).\n\nPork was purchased from the local village using 30 THB, intended to provide food for two people (MaMee and P’To) for the entire day.\nThe image records the act of cooking as real labor—transforming limited cash into sustenance through time, effort, and skill.\n\nThis is not a story of cuisine, but a verifiable unit of labor, cost, and survival economics, captured in real time.\n\nUnder DGCP principles, this proof anchors:\n\nmicro-economy reality,\n\nlabor input,\n\nconsumption planning,\nall without narrative inflation or retrospective editing.\n\nLicense\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
