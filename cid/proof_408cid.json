  "description": "This NFT documents a routine but essential activity at MaMeeFarm™ on\n29 December 2025 at 09:41 (Asia/Bangkok).\n\nThe image records the act of cutting firewood as part of daily preparation to sustain life within the farm.\nFirewood is required for cooking and caring for multiple lives — both humans and animals — especially in a context with limited resources.\n\nThis proof represents continuity of responsibility, not productivity.\nIt records preparation, readiness, and care carried out every day, regardless of conditions.\n\nCaptured and preserved under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.\n",
