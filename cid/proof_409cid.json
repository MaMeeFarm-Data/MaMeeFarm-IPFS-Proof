  "description": "At 06:26 on December 30, 2025, work begins while the sky remains dark.\nThis image records the quiet threshold before daylight—when labor starts before visibility, and intention precedes outcome.\n\nThis proof captures a real moment of continuity in MaMeeFarm™, where work is documented regardless of conditions, audience, or certainty.\nNo interpretation is added. No narrative is enhanced.\nOnly time, place, and reality are preserved.\n\nThis NFT is part of the DGCP™ (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) system, anchoring real-world activity as verifiable, timestamped evidence.\n\nLicense\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
