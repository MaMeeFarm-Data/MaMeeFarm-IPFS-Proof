  "description": "This NFT represents Proof 414 from MaMeeFarm™, recorded on the final day of 2025\nas part of the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) system.\n\nThe record documents a real-world temperature and humidity check conducted\nbefore beginning farm work on New Year's Eve. Despite being the last day\nof the year, work continues as part of the uninterrupted daily discipline\nof MaMeeFarm™.\n\nEnvironmental data was captured directly from the field without alteration.\n\nObserved conditions:\n- Temperature: 15.7°C\n- Humidity: 73%\n- Time recorded: 06:36 AM\n- Date: 2025-12-31\n\nThis proof is part of a continuous, day-by-day evidence chain designed to be\nindependently verifiable through cryptographic hashing and decentralized\ntime anchoring under the DGCP framework.\n\nLocation: MaMeeFarm™, Thailand\nSystem: DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)\n\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)\nframework.
