  "name": "DGCP | MaMeeFarm™ — Proof 415 Morning Wood-Fired Cooking",
  "description": "This NFT represents Proof 415 from MaMeeFarm™, recorded on the final day of 2025\nunder the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\n\nThe record documents the act of starting a wood-fired stove in the early morning\nto cook rice for daily living at the farm. This activity reflects subsistence\nlabor, energy self-reliance, and continuity of life without external support\nsystems.\n\nThe fire was built using collected firewood, and the cooking process began\nbefore sunrise, emphasizing routine, discipline, and real-world dependency\nbetween human labor, fuel, and food.\n\nObserved details:\n- Activity: Wood-fired stove preparation and rice cooking\n- Time recorded: 06:43 AM\n- Date: 2025-12-31\n- Energy source: Firewood (manual ignition)\n\nThis proof forms part of a continuous, non-retroactive evidence chain that\ncaptures real-life work exactly as it occurs, verifiable through cryptographic\nprocesses defined by DGCP.\n\nLocation: MaMeeFarm™, Thailand\nSystem: DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)\nframework.
