  "name": "DGCP | MaMeeFarm™ — Proof 418 Water Pump Failure and Replacement Decision",
  "description": "This NFT represents Proof 418 from MaMeeFarm™, recorded on 2025-12-31\nunder the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\n\nThe record documents an attempt to repair a water pump used for daily\nfarm operations. After inspection and repair efforts, the pump was\nconfirmed to be non-functional and beyond practical repair.\n\nThis proof captures a real operational failure and the resulting\ndecision to replace essential equipment, introducing additional\nunplanned costs to farm operations.\n\nObserved details:\n- Activity: Water pump repair attempt\n- Outcome: Pump irreparably damaged\n- Action required: Replacement with a new unit\n- Impact: Increased operational cost\n- Time recorded: 10:45 AM\n- Date: 2025-12-31\n- Context: Essential water infrastructure for farm use\n\nThis record preserves an unedited account of equipment failure and\neconomic pressure faced in small-scale farming, forming part of the\nverifiable real-world data chain under the DGCP framework.\n\nLocation: MaMeeFarm™, Thailand  \nSystem: DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)\nframework.
