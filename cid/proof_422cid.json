  "description": "On January 1, 2026 at 08:04, MaMeeFarm™ activated the household hybrid solar inverter to supply electricity for daily work activities.\n\nDue to energy storage limitations, the available working window is constrained to approximately 08:00–23:00 each day.\nWhen stored power is depleted, all work must stop.\n\nThis record documents a real operational constraint — not a failure, but a boundary condition under which work continues.\n\nDGCP captures not only actions, but the limits that shape those actions.\n\nLicense \n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
