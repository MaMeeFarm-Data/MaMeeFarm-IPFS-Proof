  "name": "DGCP Proof 427 | Off-Grid Inverter Activation Under Energy Constraints — Jan 2, 2026",
  "description": "This proof records the activation of the off-grid inverter system at MaMeeFarm™.\n\nElectricity is a limited resource within the farm’s DGCP operation.\nThe inverter is powered only during constrained working hours due to\ninsufficient battery storage to sustain continuous overnight use.\n\nThis proof documents real operational pressure:\nworking with limited energy, limited time, and no infrastructure redundancy,\nwhile maintaining uninterrupted data integrity under the DGCP framework.\n\nNo simulation. No abstraction. Only real constraints and real work.\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.\n",
