  "name": "DGCP | MaMeeFarm™ — Proof 432   Daily Inverter Startup After Battery Depletion",
  "description": "This proof documents the daily operation of the off-grid electrical system at MaMeeFarm™, recorded on\n2026-01-03 at 08:43 (Asia/Bangkok).\n\nThe inverter system was turned on in the morning after being shut down at 00:30 the previous night.\nThe system issued an alert indicating that the stored battery power had been fully depleted.\n\nThis record reflects the reality of working under limited energy resources in an off-grid environment, where electricity availability directly constrains daily operations within the DGCP system.\n\nNo simulation, reenactment, or external power source was involved.\n\nLicense\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
