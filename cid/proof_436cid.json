  "description": "This proof documents labor management at MaMeeFarm™ on January 4, 2026, focusing on zone-based work execution during the morning period.\n\nThe activity shows physical relocation and setup of materials as part of systematic farm management.\nWork is performed one zone at a time, with clear boundaries between zones:\n\nEach zone requires approximately 30–60 minutes\n\nAfter completion of Zone 1, work proceeds to Zone 2\n\nThis record reflects intentional time allocation and workload segmentation\n\nCaptured at 08:19 AM (Asia/Bangkok), this proof represents real-world labor planning and execution under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework, emphasizing traceable work processes rather than outcomes.\n\n📜 License\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
