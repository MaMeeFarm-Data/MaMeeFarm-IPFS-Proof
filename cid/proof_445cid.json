  "description": "This proof documents real-world animal care labor at MaMeeFarm.\n\nThe image records the moment of shared maternal nursing between two mother dogs.\nKhao Nung gave birth to 5 puppies, and Khao Niew gave birth to 6 puppies.\nThe puppies are being fed interchangeably by both mothers, demonstrating cooperative care under limited resources.\n\nAt the time of this record, Khao Nung is actively nursing the combined litter.\nThis activity reflects continuous, hands-on care labor performed as part of daily farm life.\n\nCaptured at 07:27 AM (local time) on January 6, 2026, this proof represents verifiable caregiving work under the DGCP framework.\n\n⚖️ License\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
