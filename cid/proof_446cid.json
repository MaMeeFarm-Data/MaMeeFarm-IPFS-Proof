  "description": "This proof documents real-world agricultural labor at MaMeeFarm.\n\nThe image records the gradual planting of spring onions in a vegetable plot inside an empty duck shelter.\nThe work is not completed in a single session but carried out consistently over time, alongside multiple daily responsibilities.\n\nAt the time of this record, the task is expected to result in a fully planted plot by the end of the day.\nThis proof reflects sustained, incremental labor rather than one-time execution.\n\nCaptured at 07:47 AM (local time) on January 6, 2026, this activity represents continuous agricultural work under real-world constraints.\n\n⚖️ License\n\nDGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025\nThis work is licensed under the DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.\nAll content is part of the MaMeeFarm™ Real-Work Data & Philosophy archive.\nRedistribution, citation, or derivative use must preserve attribution and license reference.",
