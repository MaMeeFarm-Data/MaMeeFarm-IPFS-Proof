## 🌤 Environmental Data

- **07:00 — Morning outdoor wall reading** *(Proof_314)*  
  - Temperature: **15.8°C**  
  - Humidity: **74% RH**  
  - Location Surface: Outdoor wall at MaMeeFarm  

- **16:44 — Evening duck shelter reading** *(Proof_318)*  
  - Indoor Temp: **25.6°C**  
  - Outdoor Temp: **25.3°C**  
  - Humidity: **68% RH**  
  - Location Surface: Duck shelter  

These measurements document early-morning cold conditions and late-day thermal recovery inside the duck environment.

## 🥚 Animal Output & Productivity

- **07:02 — Morning egg output** *(Proof_315)*  
  - Egg Output: **1 egg**  
  - Active Duck Count: **3**  
  - Location Surface: Duck enclosure ground  

- **07:11 — Egg weight measurement** *(Proof_316)*  
  - Egg Weight: **53.2 g**  
  - Egg Count Source: Same egg recorded in Proof_315  
  - Device Type: Digital scale  

Together these records provide verifiable evidence of daily production volume and physical egg quality from the remaining three ducks.

## 🦆 Welfare & Enclosure Routine

- **16:44 — Evening welfare check** *(Proof_317)*  
  - Duck Count: **3**  
  - Feed Status: Feed present  
  - Water Status: Water available  
  - Enclosure State: Dry ground surface  
  - Capture Type: Animal welfare observation  

This observation confirms that core welfare conditions (feed, water, enclosure state, flock behavior) remained stable by the end of the day.

## 🔗 Chain & Storage Notes

- Daily proof indices covered today: **Proof_314–Proof_318**  
- Data pipeline remains: **Pinata → IPFS → DGCP → Polygon (OpenSea)**  
- Image and NFT metadata are temporarily hosted via **Pinata/IPFS** to prevent any break in the DGCP proof chain while storage is being adjusted.

All records above are part of the continuous, append-only DGCP™ real-world data stream for 2025-12-11.
