## Daily Summary

### Environmental Conditions
- Morning temperature: ~19.8 °C
- Relative humidity: ~81%
- Season context: Cool season morning
- Environment remained calm and stable throughout the day

### Duck Welfare & Egg Production
- Duck count: 3
- Health status: Healthy, active, normal behavior
- Molting status: Active molting observed (increased feather shedding)
- Egg output: **0 eggs (confirmed)**

No eggs were produced today.
The absence of egg production is attributed to natural molting,
a normal biological cycle during which energy is redirected from egg laying
to feather regeneration.

### Farm Risk & Preventive Action
- A banana tree leaning toward the duck shelter roof was identified
- Risk: Potential damage during wind or rain
- Action required: Preventive cutting planned

### Crop Observation
- Roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa) near the farm well reached harvest readiness
- Indicators: Deep red calyces, seasonal maturity
- Growth style: Natural, low-intervention

### Routine Farm Work
- Front yard grass cutting completed
- Purpose: Safety, cleanliness, pest prevention
- Nature of work: Manual, routine farm labor

## Notes
- Zero egg days are recorded with equal importance as productive days
- This log reflects transparency in real farm life, including non-productive periods
- No anomalies, stress signals, or welfare concerns detected
