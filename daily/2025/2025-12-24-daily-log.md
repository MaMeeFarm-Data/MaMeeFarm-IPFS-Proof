## Daily Summary
This daily log serves as the **primary reference record** for DGCP activities conducted on 24 December 2025.  
All activities, proofs, and NFT records documented on this date reflect **real-world operations, observations, and data anchoring**, recorded without narrative interpretation.

The log aggregates:
- on-site environmental measurements,
- operational and subsistence activities,
- proof generation,
- NFT minting,
- cryptographic timestamp anchoring.
