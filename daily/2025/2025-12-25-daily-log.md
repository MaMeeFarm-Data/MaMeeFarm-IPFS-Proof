## Cryptographic & System Constraints

### IPFS / Network Status
- At **23:10 local time**, on-site electrical power became unavailable
- Solar-powered system exhausted battery capacity
- Further cryptographic operations paused to preserve system integrity

## DGCP System Notes

- One NFT metadata file could not be retrieved due to **IPFS gateway timeout**
- No data was altered, recalculated, or replaced
- All limitations are explicitly documented to preserve audit integrity
