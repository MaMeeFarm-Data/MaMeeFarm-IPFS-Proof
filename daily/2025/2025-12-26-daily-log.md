# DGCP Daily Log — 26 December 2025

Location: MaMeeFarm™, Thailand  
Framework: DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)

---

## Overview

This daily log documents all DGCP-related activities conducted on
26 December 2025, including proof creation, NFT operations,
and cryptographic time anchoring (Open Time Stamp).

All actions were performed in accordance with DGCP principles:
- No retroactive data modification
- No deletion of records
- Clear separation between content date and timestamp date

---

## Proof Records (26 December 2025)

The following proofs were created and documented on this date:

- Proof 389 — Morning temperature and humidity check
- Proof 390 — Morning routine: coffee and dog feeding
- Proof 391 — Sun-drying dog bedding
- Proof 392 — Observation of empty duck shelter
- Proof 393 — Completion of vegetable planting (spring onion, kale, cauliflower)

All proofs were recorded as factual observations and activities
without narrative or emotional interpretation.

## Open Time Stamp (OTS) — Backlog Resolution (Content Date: 25 December 2025)

Due to a system and power interruption on 25 December 2025,
some Open Time Stamp operations could not be completed on that day.

On the morning of 26 December 2025, the following NFT files
(originally created on 25 December 2025) were successfully
processed for Open Time Stamp (OTS) anchoring:

### NFT Files Timestamped (25 December content)

- 7 Ducks of Hope — Day 120: 5 files
- Seed of Hope — Day 152: 2 files

Total: 7 files

These operations:
- Did not involve new minting
- Did not modify original data or hashes
- Served solely to restore cryptographic continuity under DGCP

Timestamp date (26 December 2025) is explicitly separated
from content date (25 December 2025).

## NFT Operations (Content Date: 26 December 2025)

NFT creation and management for the actual work of
26 December 2025 were conducted separately and cleanly.

### NFT Sets Created (26 December content)

- 7 Ducks of Hope — Day 121: 5 files
- Seed of Hope — Day 153: 5 files

Total: 10 files

These files represent the authentic dataset of the day
and are independent from the backlog OTS operations
related to 25 December 2025.

---

## System Note (DGCP)

All operations follow DGCP core principles:

- Work is processed day by day
- No backdating or retroactive editing
- No removal of evidence
- Clear distinction between:
  - Content Date (date of activity)
  - Timestamp Date (date of cryptographic anchoring)

This approach preserves transparency, auditability,
and long-term data integrity across the DGCP system.

---

## Status

- Proofs: Complete (389–393)
- NFT (25 Dec backlog): OTS completed
- NFT (26 Dec): Created and recorded as new dataset
- DGCP continuity: Maintained without interruption
