MaMeeFarm™ | Year-End Continuous Proof

## Overview
This daily log records all verified real-world activities conducted on
December 31, 2025. Although it marks the final day of the year,
all operations continued without interruption.

All records are anchored using cryptographic hashing (SHA-256)
and decentralized time anchoring via OpenTimestamps.
