# DGCP Daily Log — 2026-01-09 (MaMeeFarm)

Date (Local): 2026-01-09  
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  
Location: MaMeeFarm, Thailand  
Framework: DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)

## 1) Summary (Fact-first)
Today’s work and records were completed under the DGCP standard across three branches:
1) Daily Proofs (Proof 459–463) — captured and prepared for OTS on markdown proof files.
2) NFT minting — completed for two collections (4 NFTs total).
3) MaMeeFarm Primary Dataset — data units recorded and OpenTimestamps created for all files.

A recurring IPFS gateway issue (504 Gateway Timeout) persisted, consistent with the previous days. The issue was documented and does not invalidate the local evidence chain.

## 2) Evidence & Activities Recorded

### 2.1 DGCP Daily Proof (Proof 459–463)
- Proof 459: Morning temperature/humidity check (daily routine)
- Proof 460: Sun-drying dog bedding (morning routine)
- Proof 461: Gradual farm work in an empty duck coop area (work by zone; capacity-aware)
- Proof 462: Clearing weeds around banana tree area (farm maintenance)
- Proof 463: Collecting dog bedding before evening dew; references Proof 460 (closed daily cycle)

Status:
- OTS: Planned/Applied for MD proof files (per workflow)
- CID: Metadata/CID workflow impacted by the same IPFS retrievability issue observed today

### 2.2 IPFS Retrievability Issue (Observed)
- Symptom: ipfs.io gateway returns “504 Gateway Timeout”
- Observation: content providers/peers were not reachable within timeout period
- Impact: retrievability/preview via public gateway may fail temporarily
- Mitigation: all activities and files remain recorded locally and in repository; proofs and dataset remain verifiable by hash/OTS/commit

### 2.3 NFT Minting (Completed)
Minted 4 NFTs today:
- 7 Ducks Of Hope: Day 135 Part 1–2 (2 files)
- Seed of Hope: Day 167 Part 1–2 (2 files)

Correction / Admission (DGCP transparency note):
- A mismatch was detected in a previously recorded NFT label:
  - Intended: Day 134 Part 2
  - Actually minted/entered: Day 133 Part 2
- This is acknowledged as an operator error (human mistake) and is recorded here transparently as part of the DGCP integrity practice.
- Action: keep the minted record as-is (no silent edits), and maintain a clear correction note in the log for auditability.

### 2.4 MaMeeFarm Primary Dataset (Completed)
- Data units: recorded for the day
- OTS: completed for all dataset files (per statement)
- Status: operational and continued without issues

## 3) Integrity Statement
- No evidence was removed or rewritten to hide mistakes.
- The chain remains intact because:
  - Work is recorded across multiple branches (Proof / NFT / Dataset)
  - Commits and OTS provide cryptographic anchoring
  - Temporary IPFS gateway failure affects retrieval convenience, not evidence validity

## 4) Pending / Next Actions (Operational)
- Wait for IPFS gateway/peer retrievability to recover, then resume CID/metadata verification steps as needed.
- Continue daily proof capture and routine operations.
