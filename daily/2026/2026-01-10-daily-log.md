## Overview

This daily log records real-world activities, system conditions,
and operational constraints at MaMeeFarm™ on 2026-01-10.

All entries follow DGCP principles:
fact-first, traceable, non-retroactive, and transparent.

## Primary Dataset (MaMeeFarm™)

Primary data units for this date were recorded **partially**.

### Constraint Notice

Due to **limited electricity availability**, not all data units
could be fully processed and timestamped within the same day.

- Some data units were recorded and OpenTimestamped today
- Remaining data units will be completed and timestamped
  when electricity becomes available on the following morning

This limitation is acknowledged and logged according to DGCP standards.
No data is altered or backdated.

## System Status

- IPFS Gateway: 504 Gateway Timeout observed
- Impact: CID retrieval and metadata access intermittently unavailable
- Response:
  - Issue documented with evidence
  - Proof, dataset, and NFT records preserved
  - No data deletion or revision performed

---

## Governance Notes

- This log reflects **actual operational constraints**
  (energy availability, infrastructure instability)
- Partial completion is explicitly documented
- Continuity is maintained through next-day completion
- DGCP integrity remains intact
