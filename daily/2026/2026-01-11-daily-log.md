# DGCP Daily Log — 2026-01-11

Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)  
Location: MaMeeFarm, Thailand  
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok

## Summary

This daily log records real-world farm activities conducted on
**2026-01-11** under actual operational constraints.

All events, limitations, and system issues are documented transparently
in accordance with DGCP principles.

No data was fabricated, omitted, or retroactively modified.

---

## Operational Conditions

- IPFS public gateways were unstable and intermittently unreachable
  throughout the day (504 Gateway Timeout).
- Electricity availability was limited, affecting processing capacity.
- As a result:
  - CID verification could not be completed within the same day.
  - Some metadata operations were deferred intentionally.
- These constraints are recorded as part of the evidence, not treated as errors.

## DGCP Proofs Recorded Today

Total proofs recorded: **5**

- **Proof 469** — Feeding dogs in the farm (routine daily care)
- **Proof 470** — Morning environment view of adjacent cornfield  
  (Referenced temperature data unit: 00165)
- **Proof 471** — Watering vegetable beds  
  (4-liter watering can × 2 rounds = 8 liters per bed, repeated daily)  
  (Referenced data unit: 00167)
- **Proof 472** — Clearing grass around papaya tree  
  (Improving growth conditions by reducing nutrient competition)
- **Proof 473** — Preparing firewood during sunlight hours  
  (Referenced data unit: 00176)

Each proof was captured from real activities and documented sequentially.
OpenTimestamp (OTS) was applied to markdown files only.

## NFT Minting Status

NFT minting was completed successfully:

- **7 Ducks Of Hope**
  - Day 137 — Part 1
  - Day 137 — Part 2
- **Seed of Hope**
  - Day 169 — Part 1
  - Day 169 — Part 2

Metadata access via IPFS gateways was unstable at the time of logging.
Minting status is recorded based on transaction completion, not gateway availability.

## Primary Dataset Status

- MaMeeFarm Primary Dataset data units were recorded today.
- OpenTimestamp (OTS) was successfully applied to all completed data unit files.
- Some data unit processing was postponed due to electricity constraints.
- No data loss occurred.

---

## Integrity Statement

This daily log preserves:

- Chronological continuity
- Transparent disclosure of constraints
- Verifiable linkage between work, proofs, and datasets

DGCP does not require same-day completeness,
only truthful recording of what occurred and why.
