# DGCP Daily Log — 2026-01-12

Date (Local): 2026-01-12  
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  
Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)  
Record Type: daily_log (markdown)

## Summary
Daily operations continued with verifiable work records (Proof 474–478).
OpenTimestamp (OTS) was applied to proof markdown files only.
CID/JSON anchoring is deferred due to ongoing IPFS gateway metadata retrieval failures.
NFT minting succeeded for two collections (7 Ducks of Hope and Seed of Hope), but metadata retrieval remains unstable.
MaMeeFarm Primary Dataset continued OTS file-by-file, but 일부งานไม่ครบวัน due to farm power constraints.

## What was completed today (verifiable outputs)
- Proof 474–478: Created as markdown files under `proof/` and timestamped via OTS (md only).
- NFT minting completed:
  - 7 Ducks Of Hope — Day 138 Part 1–2 (minted)
  - Seed of Hope — Day 170 Part 1–2 (minted)
- MaMeeFarm Primary Dataset: OTS applied file-by-file (partial completion today due to limited electricity).

## Issues / Constraints (recorded)
- IPFS gateway timeout / metadata retrievability issue persists:
  - Unable to retrieve content within timeout period (504 Gateway Timeout observed).
  - CID/JSON creation for proofs deferred until metadata can be reliably retrieved.
- Power constraint in the farm limited completion of all dataset processing for the day.

## Integrity Notes
- Proof layer uses: markdown + OTS (today).
- CID/JSON layer intentionally deferred (not missing by accident; deferred due to technical retrievability limitations).
- This daily log documents both completed work and constraints to preserve traceability.

## Pointers
- Proof range today: 474–478
- Proof OTS scope today: md only
- CID/JSON scope today: deferred
- NFT mint scope today: completed; retrievability verification pending (platform constraint)
