Date (Local): 2026-01-14  
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  
Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP  

## Daily Summary
This daily log records real-world activities, environmental observations, and system constraints at MaMeeFarm on 2026-01-14.
All records are based on direct observation, captured evidence, and actual operational conditions of the day.

## Activities & Proofs
- Proof 484: Daily temperature and humidity record (second measurement)
- Proof 485: Morning dog feeding activity
- Proof 486: Morning dew observation on avocado leaves
- Proof 487: Morning garden activity on moist soil
- Proof 488: Cha-om tree maintenance observation and preparation

## Environmental Context
- Morning temperature and humidity recorded before farm work.
- Dew observed on plant leaves indicating high overnight and early-morning humidity.
- Soil moisture observed in vegetable beds during morning garden activity.

Referenced data units:
- Data Unit 00251
- Data Unit 00253
- Data Unit 00259

## NFT Activity
- 7 Ducks of Hope — Day 140 (Part 1–2): Minted
- Seed of Hope — Day 172 (Part 1–2): Minted
- NFT OTS: Pending due to system and power constraints

## Data Unit & OTS Status
- Data units were created and committed during available working hours.
- OTS files were generated for completed data units.
- Power limitations restricted full-day operations; however, all recorded data units correspond to actual work performed during available time windows.

## System Constraints & Issues
- IPFS gateway (ipfs.io) experienced repeated 504 Gateway Timeout errors during metadata retrieval.
- CID metadata could not be retrieved at the time, although minting operations were successful.
- This condition is classified as an external network and gateway constraint, not a data integrity failure.

## Integrity Statement
All records in this log reflect real-world activities and conditions as they occurred.
No data backfilling, reconstruction, or synthetic completion was performed.
