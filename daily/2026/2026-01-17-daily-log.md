## Activities Recorded (Factual)

- Morning routine: feeding dogs as part of daily animal care.
- Land work conducted in backyard and adjacent areas within physical capacity limits.
- Crop activities included:
  - Zone-based planting (pumpkin).
  - Ground preparation and maintenance.
- Preventive environmental management conducted earlier in related proofs (reference continuity maintained).
- Food consumption recorded under cost and supply constraints.
