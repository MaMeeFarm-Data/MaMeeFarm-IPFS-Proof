Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  

## Project
MaMeeFarm™

## Framework
DGCP

## Summary (Factual)
- Proofs completed today: Proof 504–508
- Proof markdown files created and OpenTimestamps (OTS) completed for the proof files.
- CID/JSON metadata retrieval was not possible today due to gateway/metadata access limitations; CID work is deferred.
- NFTs minted successfully:
  - 7 Ducks of Hope — Day 144 (Part 1–2)
  - Seed Of Hope — Day 176 (Part 1–2)
- Metadata retrieval for minted NFTs is pending for later processing.

## Proof Register
- Proof 504: Dog bedding sheet drying (daily care evidence)
- Proof 505: Morning vegetable watering
- Proof 506: Internet/day-start activation under inverter limitation (screen not displaying)
- Proof 507: Evening vegetable watering
- Proof 508: End-of-day closure — gate closed to separate home zone and farm zone

## Primary Dataset Status (DGCP Data Units)
- Primary dataset work continued on a file-by-file basis with OTS processing.
- The full-day workload was not completed due to energy constraints.
- Constraint: solar power system did not provide continuous 24-hour operation.

## Constraints & Operational Notes
- Infrastructure/energy limitation: solar system runtime constraint impacted completion of daily data operations.
- IPFS gateway / metadata retrieval limitation: CID/JSON metadata extraction deferred.

## Next Actions (Deferred / Pending)
- Create CID/JSON files for relevant proofs and NFTs after metadata becomes accessible.
- Continue primary dataset processing and complete remaining OTS items when energy availability allows.
