# DGCP™ Daily Log — 2026-01-19
Project: MaMeeFarm™
Framework: DGCP™
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok

## 🧭 Daily Summary
This daily log records real-world farm operations, proof generation,
and data continuity under constrained energy conditions.

All entries reflect actual activities without retroactive modification.

---

## 🧾 Proof Activity
- Proof IDs covered today: **509–513**
- All `proof/proof_xxx.md` files were created
- **OTS completed** for proof MD files
- **CID proof + OTS completed**

---

## 🖼 NFT Activity
- NFT Collections:
  - **7 Ducks of Hope — Day 145 (Part 1–2)**
  - **Seed Of Hope — Day 177 (Part 1–2)**
- Minting status: **Completed**
- Metadata retrieval: **Temporarily deferred**
- Reason: IPFS gateway performance & energy constraints
- Follow-up handling: **Tracked via DGCP issue log (no chain impact)**

---

## 🧬 Dataset Primary
- Dataset files generated sequentially
- OTS applied **per file**
- Dataset work **not completed for full 24h cycle**
- Constraint:
  - Solar-powered system
  - Limited continuous energy availability
  - Operations executed within feasible energy window

---

## ⚙️ System & Operational Constraints
- Solar power system could not sustain full 24-hour operation
- Work prioritization applied:
  1. Proof integrity
  2. OTS completion
  3. Chain continuity
- No data loss
- No proof gap
- No chain break

---

## 🔗 Chain Integrity Status
- DGCP proof chain remains **intact and verifiable**
- Any infrastructure-level adjustments are documented separately
  via **DGCP Issues (governance layer)**
