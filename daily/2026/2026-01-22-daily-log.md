# DGCP Daily Log

Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP  
Date (Local): 2026-01-22  
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  

## Summary (Operational)
- Proof range referenced: 519–523
- Proof .md completed and OpenTimestamps (OTS) completed for the set.
- CID + OTS completed, but evidence commit was not executed due to power loss (solar limitation) and unexpected computer shutdown.
- NFT minting completed:
  - 7 Ducks of Hope: Day 148
  - Seed of Hope: Day 80
  - Metadata retrieval not completed (pending later execution).
- Primary Dataset: continued work on files and OTS.
- Energy constraint: solar power availability did not cover a full 24-hour cycle, resulting in incomplete end-of-day processing.

## Proof / OTS Status
- Proof 519–523:
  - proof markdown: completed
  - OTS: completed
  - CID + OTS: completed
  - Git commit for evidence: pending (power loss / computer shutdown)

## NFT Status (Non-critical to proof chain)
- 7 Ducks of Hope — Day 148:
  - mint: completed
  - metadata retrieval: pending
- Seed of Hope — Day 80:
  - mint: completed
  - metadata retrieval: pending

## Primary Dataset (MaMeeFarm™ Primary Dataset)
- Continued creation of dataset files and OTS records.
- End-of-day completion was limited by solar power constraints.

## Notes (Systems / Constraints)
- Energy availability is a hard constraint in the field environment.
- Work execution and data anchoring proceed when power is available.
- Pending steps are tracked and can be completed later without rewriting history.
