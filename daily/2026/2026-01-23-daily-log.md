## Dataset Primary (Ground Truth Data)
- Dataset files: created sequentially
- OTS: completed per file
- Status: **Incomplete for the full day**

### Constraint
- Farm operates under a solar power system
- Electricity was unavailable for a full 24-hour cycle
- Processing stopped due to power limitation
- No data was rewritten or backfilled

---

## System Integrity Statement
- DGCP proof chain remains intact
- No missing proof indices
- No CID mismatch detected
- No retroactive edits performed

---

## Notes
Operational interruptions caused by real-world energy constraints
are recorded as part of the dataset and preserved as ground truth.
