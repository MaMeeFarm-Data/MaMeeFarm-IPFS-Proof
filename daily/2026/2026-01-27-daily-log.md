# Daily Log – 2026-01-27

## Overview
This daily log records real-world operations at MaMeeFarm™ on January 27, 2026,
under the DGCP™ (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.

All entries reflect evidence-based activities documented through Proof files,
Data Units, cryptographic timestamps, and IPFS references.

---

## Proof Summary
The following Proof records were completed and committed for this date:

- Proof 549 – Farm gate opening for daily operations (FZ-03, FZ-04)
- Proof 550 – Home inverter activation under power constraints (HZ-02)
- Proof 551 – Water pump preparation and activation to FZ-03, FZ-04
- Proof 552 – Water tank WT-M-0003 filled to capacity
- Proof 553 – Farm gate closure after daily operations (FZ-03, FZ-04)

All Proof MD files, CID JSON files, and corresponding OpenTimestamp (OTS)
records were successfully created and committed.

## NFT Activity
- 7 Ducks of Hope – Day 153 (Minted)
- Seed of Hope – Day 185 (Minted)

OpenTimestamp (OTS) generation for NFT metadata could not be completed due to
temporary IPFS gateway error (HTTP 504).

NFTs are used strictly as visual reference windows.
Authoritative records remain in Proof, Data Unit, and cryptographic logs.
No impact to data integrity or system validity.

---

## Dataset (Primary)
Primary Dataset files were created incrementally on a per-file basis,
with OpenTimestamp (OTS) applied where possible.

Full-day dataset completion was not achieved due to energy constraints.

---

## System Constraints
Farm operations on this date were conducted under limited electrical availability.

The solar-based power system did not provide continuous 24-hour operation,
resulting in partial suspension of data processing and dataset generation.

This limitation is inherent to real-world conditions and is recorded
without modification or normalization.

---

## Status
- Proofs: Complete (549–553)
- CIDs: Complete
- OTS (Proof/CID): Complete
- NFTs: Minted (OTS pending due to gateway issue)
- Dataset Primary: Partial (energy-constrained)
