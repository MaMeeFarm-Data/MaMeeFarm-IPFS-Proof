# Daily Log – 2026-01-28

## Overview
This daily log records real-world operations at MaMeeFarm™ on January 28, 2026,
under the DGCP™ (Data Governance & Continuous Proof) framework.

All records reflect actual field activities, system states, and operational
constraints without normalization or post-adjustment.

---

## Proof Summary
The following Proof records were completed and committed for this date:

- Proof 554 – Morning feeding activity (HZ-02)
- Proof 555 – Power system activation under limited solar resources
- Proof 556 – Evening feeding activity (HZ-02)
- Proof 557 – Banana inflorescence cut and observation start (BAN-0003, FZ-03)
- Proof 558 – Farm access path used for outgoing work movement

All Proof markdown files, CID JSON files, and corresponding OpenTimestamp (OTS)
records were successfully generated and committed.

## NFT Activity
- 7 Ducks of Hope – Day 154 (Minted)
- Seed of Hope – Day 186 (Minted)

OpenTimestamp (OTS) generation for NFT metadata could not be completed due to
temporary IPFS gateway error (HTTP 504).

NFTs are used strictly as visual reference windows.
Authoritative records remain in Proof files, Data Units, and cryptographic logs.
This issue has no impact on data integrity.

---

## Dataset (Primary)
Primary Dataset files were created incrementally on a per-file basis.
OpenTimestamp (OTS) was applied where possible.

Full-day dataset completion was not achieved.

---

## System Constraints
Farm operations on this date were conducted under limited electrical availability.

The solar-powered energy system did not provide continuous 24-hour operation,
resulting in partial suspension of dataset processing and OTS execution.

These constraints reflect real-world operating conditions and are recorded
as-is.

---

## Status
- Proofs: Complete (554–558)
- CIDs: Complete
- OTS (Proof/CID): Complete
- NFTs: Minted (OTS pending – gateway issue)
- Dataset Primary: Partial (energy-constrained)
