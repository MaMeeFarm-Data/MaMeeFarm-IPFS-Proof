## Primary Dataset Status
Primary Dataset records were generated incrementally on a per-file basis.

OpenTimestamp (OTS) generation was partially completed. Full-day dataset
completion was not achieved due to limited availability of electricity from
the solar-powered farm system, resulting in non-continuous operation.

---

## Operational Constraints
- Power Source: Solar-powered system
- Constraint: Electricity not available continuously for 24 hours
- Impact: Partial interruption of dataset processing and OTS generation

These constraints are documented as part of real-world operating conditions.

---

## Compliance
All records for this date comply with:

**DGCP | MMFARM-POL-2025**

This log preserves factual accuracy, traceability, and continuity of
real-world operations at MaMeeFarm™.
