## Dataset Primary Status

- Dataset files: Created sequentially  
- OTS processing: **Partially completed**  

### Limitation Note
Due to reliance on a **solar power system**, electricity availability did not cover a full 24-hour cycle.  
As a result, Dataset Primary OTS generation could not be completed for all files within the same day.

This limitation is recorded transparently and does not affect the integrity of completed Proof or CID records.

## System Integrity Statement

All completed records for this date comply with:
- DGCP structural standards  
- Traceability requirements  
- Fact-only, non-narrative documentation principles  

No data rewriting, inference, or retroactive modification occurred.
