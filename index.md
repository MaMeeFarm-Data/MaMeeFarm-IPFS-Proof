# Proof Index

This repository contains verifiable records of real-world observations under the DGCP framework.  
Each proof documents factual states without optimization, correction, or narrative enhancement.

The purpose of this index is to provide conceptual orientation, not summarization or interpretation.

## Proof Characteristics

All proofs in this repository follow these principles:

- Recorded as observed, not as intended outcomes
- Include neutral, negative, and depletion states
- Do not assume recovery, continuity, or success
- Preserve constraint-driven reality without intervention

---

## Structural Signals Captured

The proofs collectively capture system-level signals, including but not limited to:

- Resource constraints
- Stepwise loss and depletion
- Absence of redundancy or buffer capacity
- Non-recoverable states
- Temporal continuation of loss beyond initial events

These signals are treated as valid data, not anomalies.

## Conceptual Reference

Certain proofs correspond to higher-level concepts documented separately under the `concepts/` directory.  
One such concept is **stepwise depletion without intervention**, where reduction occurs across time without replenishment due to factual constraints rather than choice or neglect.

This index does not prioritize proofs by outcome quality.  
Presence in this repository indicates only that an event occurred and was recorded truthfully.

## Interpretation Notice

This repository does not assign meaning, judgment, or narrative framing.  
Interpretation, if required, must be derived from external analysis layers.
