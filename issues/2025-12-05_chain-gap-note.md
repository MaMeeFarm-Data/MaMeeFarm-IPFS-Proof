# DGCP™ Issue Log — 2025-12-05
Documenting anomalies, decisions, and recovery actions  
for long-term transparency and auditability.
---
Note for Proof Index 199–221:
Actual collected proofs today were 199–221; Proof_222–224 will be
created tomorrow as documentation-only files to maintain audit clarity.
No fabricated data. Chain continuity preserved.

## 1. Summary of the Issue
Due to time limitations and workload constraints,  
data for Proof_199–221 was collected, verified,  
and timestamped successfully, but Google Sheet updates  
and detailed log separation could not be completed in real time.

---

## 2. Continuity Action Taken
To prevent a break in the DGCP™ chain, the following action  
was prioritized:

**✔ Completed OpenTimestamp (OTS) sealing for the daily file**  
`MMFARM_DGCP_DAILY_2025-12-05_Proof001-221.pdf`

This ensures the authenticity and immutability of the day’s data  
even before supportive logs are fully organized.

---

## 3. Proof Index Note
Although new files were created for:

- Proof_222  
- Proof_223  
- Proof_224  

The actual real-world dataset collected today covers:

**✔ Proof_199–221**

The additional proof files were generated to maintain index  
continuity but contain an internal note clarifying the  
actual data range.

---

## 4. Why This Approach Was Necessary
- Prevents chain fragmentation  
- Ensures cryptographic continuity  
- Maintains audit reliability  
- Allows missing documentation to be recovered later  
- Supports the “real-world-first” workflow of DGCP™

---

## 5. next Steps
- Update Google Sheet once time permits  
- Merge daily logs into structured format (MD + JSON)  
- Add retrospective annotations for Proof_199–221  
- Continue maintaining continuity-first workflow

---

## 6. Integrity Statement
No data was fabricated, altered, or omitted.  
All entries reflect real-world events as they occurred.  
Timestamp sealing was executed first to ensure  
immutable truth preservation.
