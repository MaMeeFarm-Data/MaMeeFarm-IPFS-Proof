# DGCP™ Proof Explanation — Proof 222–240  
Date: 2025-12-06  
System: DGCP™ V2 (Simplified Intake – 3 Fields)  
License: MMFARM-POL-2025

---

## Overview
Proof 222–240 represent the first full batch processed using the DGCP™ V2 simplified intake workflow.  
This new system uses only three fields (Proof ID, IPFS Link, CID), greatly increasing speed, reducing friction, and ensuring accurate timestamps through Google Form’s automatic capture system.

This batch demonstrates that DGCP™ can handle high-frequency real-world data submission while maintaining integrity, traceability, and structural consistency.

## Key Improvements in Proof 222–240

### **1. Accurate Automatic Timestamps**
Each Proof entry now receives an automatic timestamp from Google Forms.  
This eliminates manual entry errors and locks the true moment the evidence was recorded.

### **2. Faster Proof Generation**
The simplified 3-field workflow drastically increases proof throughput.  
More than 10 proofs can be created within a few minutes, supporting heavy daily workloads.

### **3. Clean and Stable Data Structure**
Master Sheet V2 receives data with zero column shift, zero corruption, and no formatting failures—problems that previously occurred in older versions.

### **4. Verified IPFS Links and CIDs**
Every proof contains valid IPFS gateway links and CIDs, ensuring full traceability across decentralized storage networks.

### **5. First Fully Operational Day of DGCP™ V2**
This batch marks the official first day that DGCP™ V2 runs at full stability and speed.  
It confirms that the new workflow is ready for continuous large-scale deployment.

## Summary
Proof 222–240 are a major milestone for MaMeeFarm™.  
They confirm that:

- DGCP™ V2 is faster  
- DGCP™ V2 is more stable  
- DGCP™ V2 reduces human workload  
- DGCP™ V2 supports massive scaling  

This version is now suitable for national-level and global-level real-world data governance.
