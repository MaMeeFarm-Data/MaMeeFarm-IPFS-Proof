## DGCP Standard Transition Note: MD + OTS to MD + JSON + OTS (Dec 10–15, 2025)

## Context

This issue documents a DGCP™ daily evidence standard transition
that occurred during December 10–15, 2025.

During this period, DGCP daily evidence packs were generated
using the following structure:
- MD (human-readable record)
- OTS (Bitcoin timestamp record)

At that time, JSON structured metadata files were not yet a
mandatory component of the DGCP™ daily evidence standard.

Starting December 16, 2025, DGCP™ formally adopted the complete
daily evidence structure:
- MD (human-readable record)
- JSON (structured, machine-readable metadata)
- OTS (Bitcoin timestamp record)

## Important Notes

- This issue is opened on January 1, 2026, after the fact,
  for documentation and transparency purposes.
- No historical evidence files were modified, regenerated,
  or replaced.
- All OTS evidence packs from December 10–15, 2025 remain
  immutable and verifiable via IPFS and OpenTimestamps.
- DGCP™ follows a strict append-only principle.

This issue serves solely as contextual documentation to ensure
correct interpretation, long-term auditability, and governance
clarity regarding early December 2025 records.
