# Zero Duck State — No Ducks Remain at MaMeeFarm

**Date:** 2025-12-19  
**Location:** MaMeeFarm, Lampang, Thailand  
**Status:** Zero ducks remaining

This issue records a critical system state at MaMeeFarm.

As of this date, all ducks that once formed the living data source of the farm are gone.  
From an initial count of seven ducks, real-life events have led to a complete depletion.

This is a factual condition, not a narrative:

- No ducks remain in the coop  
- No ducks remain in the field  
- No ducks remain as living proof sources  

## Related Record

A formal concept record has been created at:

- `concepts/2025-12-19-no-ducks-remain.md`

This issue exists to:

- Mark the transition to a **zero-duck state** in the system
- Provide an auditable checkpoint in the DGCP chain
- Treat absence and loss as valid ground truth
- Link operational reality with documented records

This is not a task or bug.  
This is a **system condition**.

> DGCP records reality — even when nothing remains.
