## 1. Description

This record documents the moment when the third duck returned to the MaMeeFarm™ shelter on a rainy morning.  
After several days of believing only two ducks survived, this return confirms that three ducks are now alive at the farm.

This event is historically important for MaMeeFarm™, because it changes the survival count of the original 7 ducks and
strengthens the narrative of resilience that led to DGCP™ — Duck Governance & Continuous Proof.
