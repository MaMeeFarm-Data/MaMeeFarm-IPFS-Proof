## Description
A MaMeeFarm™ dog peeks over the concrete edge, watching a plate of freshly cut papaya at **13:01** on **2025-12-03**.  
With no other food available today, papaya becomes the shared meal between P’Toh and the animals.  
This moment captures the raw simplicity and resilience of daily farm life,  
supporting the **DGCP™ Human-Work & Animal Interaction Layer**.
