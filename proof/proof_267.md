## 1. Event Summary  
Morning duck coop temperature recorded at **18.2°C** with **90% humidity** at 06:56.  
These conditions indicate cold, moisture-dense air, consistent with the day's  
reduced egg output and biological stress signals in small-flock poultry.

## 3. Measurements  
- **Temperature:** 18.2°C  
- **Humidity:** 90%  
- **Environmental Condition:** Cold, moisture-heavy air  
- **Correlation:** Matches low egg output (1 egg) and morning stress indicators

## 4. Notes  
Part of MaMeeFarm™ DGCP Continuous Proof:  
**environmental metrics + biological output correlation.**

Cold + high humidity environments often suppress egg production  
and increase flock metabolic stress, especially during seasonal transitions.
