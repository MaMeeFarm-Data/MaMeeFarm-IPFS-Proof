## 1. Event Summary  
A stored bundle of shallots has begun sprouting at **14:26**, indicating natural  
readiness for replanting. The sprouting behavior reflects moisture influence,  
humidity conditions, and biological regeneration within MaMeeFarm’s environment.

## 3. Observations  
- **Unit Type:** Crop-readiness & Biological-response  
- **Sprouting stage:** Active growth with visible green shoots  
- **Storage condition:** Hanging bundle under shaded roof  
- **Environmental influence:** Moisture retention + air humidity  
- **Agricultural relevance:** Seed-cycle regeneration → ready for replanting

## 4. Notes  
This proof contributes to DGCP’s continuous agricultural dataset by  
documenting real-world biological behavior, seed-cycle regeneration,  
and crop readiness. These patterns support long-term crop-cycle prediction  
and real regenerative agriculture modeling.
