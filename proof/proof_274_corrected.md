## 1. Event Summary  
Temperature and humidity recorded at **14:27** on the exterior wall show:  
- **26.4°C temperature**  
- **60% humidity**

This measurement captures the real-time micro-climate conditions around MaMeeFarm™,  
critical for validating crop behavior, animal conditions, and daily environmental fluctuation.

## 3. Observations  
- **Unit Type:** Environmental Monitoring Unit  
- **Location:** Exterior clay-brick wall  
- **Temp/Humidity:** 26.4°C / 60% RH  
- **Environmental significance:**  
  - Influences crop moisture retention  
  - Impacts duck comfort & hydration needs  
  - Helps interpret biological responses recorded in Proof 271–273  
  - Anchor point for micro-climate fluctuation modeling under DGCP™

## 4. Notes  
This proof strengthens DGCP’s environmental dataset by providing ground-truth  
temperature/humidity readings at the exact time surrounding multiple biological  
events on the farm. These readings validate crop-response proofs and animal-care  
patterns, enabling long-term environmental prediction models.

## 5. DGCP™ Correction Log  

- **2025-12-08 (initial commit):** Temperature was written as **28.4°C** by mistake.  
- **2025-12-08 (correction):** Verified original sensor photo and confirmed value is  
  **26.4°C**. Updated all text references to 26.4°C while keeping the original CID  
  and media evidence unchanged.
