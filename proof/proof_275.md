## 1. Event Summary  
MaMee harvested a full banana bunch from the farm at **17:03**,  
documenting real agricultural yield and seasonal crop maturity under MaMeeFarm™.

This harvest captures:
- labor performed,
- crop productivity,
- tree lifecycle stage,
- and environmental growth response —  
all part of the **RWD Crop Harvest Unit** under DGCP™.

The image shows the freshly cut banana cluster and the harvested tree, validating real-world farm work, biomass removal, and natural crop progression.

## 3. Observations  
- **Unit Type:** RWD Crop Harvest Unit  
- **Crop:** Banana (Musa spp.)  
- **Tree Status:** Mature, ready for cluster removal  
- **Harvest Output:** Full banana bunch (large, green maturity stage)  
- **Agricultural significance:**  
  - Confirms crop cycle timing  
  - Measures biomass yield  
  - Shows seasonal sunlight effect (late afternoon harvest)  
  - Anchors long-term crop-cycle prediction in DGCP™

## 4. Notes  
This proof provides real-world crop yield evidence critical for training  
next-generation RWD agricultural models. It establishes measurable units of labor,  
biological response, and productivity within MaMeeFarm™.
