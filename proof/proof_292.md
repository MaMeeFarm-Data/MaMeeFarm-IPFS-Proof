## 📝 Description  
A banana tree collapsed at **17:39 on 2025-12-09** due to lack of a support pole.  
The mature bunch was heavy, causing the trunk to snap under its own weight.

This event highlights the need for proper bracing practices for tall banana plants at MaMeeFarm™, especially during fruit maturity stages.

This entry is recorded under DGCP™ Environmental & Crop Condition Tracking to verify real-world biological and structural vulnerabilities on the farm.
