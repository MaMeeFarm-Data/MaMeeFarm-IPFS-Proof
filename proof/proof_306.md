## 🐶 DGCP™ Animal Welfare & Behavioral Observation Surface  
Newborn puppy event recorded at **15:44 on 2025-12-10**.

Dog **Khao Nung** gave birth today.  
Mother **Khao Niew**, who recently delivered her own litter,  
mistakenly carried one of the new pups, assuming it was hers —  
a case of maternal instinct crossover.

To ensure safety, Khao Nung was relocated to a protected rear-zone area.

This event is logged under DGCP™ Animal Welfare & Behavioral Observation,  
critical for tracking maternal behavior patterns, cross-nesting risk,  
and newborn survival monitoring.
