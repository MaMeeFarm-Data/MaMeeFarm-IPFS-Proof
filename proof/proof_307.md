## 🐶 DGCP™ Animal Welfare & Behavioral Observation Surface

Recorded at **15:54 on 2025-12-10**.  
Dog **Khao-Nueng** shows clear pre-labor symptoms including panting, pacing, and heightened anxiety — indicators typical of the final stage before delivery.

Earlier, one newborn pup was mistakenly carried by **Khao-Niew**, causing emotional stress for Khao-Nueng.  
MaMee provided physical and emotional support to stabilize her before relocating her to a safe birthing zone.

This event is logged under DGCP™ Animal Welfare & Behavioral Observation Surface —  
used for tracking maternal stress, cross-nesting events, pre-labor indicators,  
and necessary human intervention to ensure safe delivery.
