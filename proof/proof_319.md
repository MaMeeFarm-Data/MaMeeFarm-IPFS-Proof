## 📘 Context  
This record documents a morning welfare check on the three remaining ducks at MaMeeFarm  
with no egg production observed during this cycle.  
The ducks were healthy, active, and behaviorally stable.

Recording verified zero-output events is a critical component of the DGCP™ continuous proof system,  
ensuring that absence of production is transparently documented alongside positive welfare conditions.
