## 🌊 Resource Monitoring — Groundwater (Farm Well)
Today, the water level in the farm well was observed to be significantly lower than usual.  
This decline raises concern about water availability during the upcoming dry season, particularly between **March and May**.

While there is currently still usable water, the trend suggests that **well maintenance and dredging will be required around March** to sustain farm operations.

This record documents an **early warning signal**, enabling forward planning for water management and farm resilience.
