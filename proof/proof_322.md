## 🥚 Event Summary
In the late afternoon, during a routine visit to feed the ducks and refresh their water, one egg was unexpectedly found near the enclosure.

Earlier in the morning, no eggs were recorded.  
The discovery confirms that egg-laying can occur outside the usual morning window and reflects natural, unstressed behavior of the ducks.

This moment was observed during normal farm care activities, without intervention or forced conditions — simply daily life at MaMeeFarm.
