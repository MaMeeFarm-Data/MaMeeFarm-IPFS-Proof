## Observation (Human Narrative)

Today, no eggs were found at MaMeeFarm.

The ducks appeared healthy, active, and calm, with no signs of illness or stress.  
However, a noticeable increase in feather shedding was observed, indicating that the ducks have entered a molting phase.

Molting is a natural biological process during which egg production may temporarily stop as energy is redirected toward feather renewal.  
This condition is normal and does not indicate a welfare or environmental issue.

This record documents a verified zero-egg day caused by natural molting, reinforcing transparency by recording both productive and non-productive periods as part of real farm life.
