## Description

Today, a banana tree near the duck shelter was observed leaning toward the roof structure.  
The position creates a potential risk of falling and damaging the shelter, especially during strong wind or rain.

This situation requires immediate preventive action — cutting the tree before it falls — to protect the animals, the shelter, and ongoing farm operations.

This record reflects real farm responsibility:  
not waiting for damage to happen, but acting early to reduce risk.

This is daily farm work that often goes unseen, yet is essential to safety and continuity.
