## Description (as recorded on OpenSea)
Today, the egg laid at MaMeeFarm weighed 54.4 grams.

This egg was produced by the last remaining duck at the farm.
At this moment, only one duck remains.

This record does not dramatize the situation.
It does not speculate about what happened to the others.

It documents a simple, measurable fact:

one duck  
one egg  
one weight measurement

Even with only one duck left, the work continues,
and the data is still recorded with the same care.

This is real farm life, recorded as it is, without assumptions.
