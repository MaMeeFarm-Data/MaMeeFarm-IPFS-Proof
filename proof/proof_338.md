# Proof_338 — Aging Solar Panels with Reduced Efficiency

## Overview
This proof documents the current condition of the solar power system at MaMeeFarm.

The solar panels installed on the roof are old and no longer operate at their original efficiency.
Although still physically present, their ability to capture and convert sunlight has declined.

## Observed Conditions
- Solar panels are aging and inefficient
- Power generation is inconsistent
- Farm has no access to public electricity
- Farm has no access to public tap water

## Operational Impact
These limitations directly affect daily farm activities.
Energy and water constraints are part of normal operations at MaMeeFarm.

## Documentation Principle
This record does not complain.
It does not exaggerate.
It does not compare with what should exist elsewhere.

It documents only what is present and observable today.

Old infrastructure, limited resources, and constraints are part of real farm life.
This proof records the system as it is.
