## Description

This proof documents the morning environmental conditions at **MaMeeFarm**, recorded on  
**16 December 2025 at 06:54 AM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows a digital thermometer–hygrometer device placed against a brick wall inside the farm area. The device displays a **temperature of 18.0°C** and **relative humidity of 76%**, indicating a cool and humid early-morning atmosphere.

Such environmental data is critical for understanding real-world operating conditions of small-scale farms, especially those without access to controlled infrastructure such as grid electricity or climate regulation systems. These measurements directly influence animal health, feed efficiency, water usage, and daily labor planning.

This record is captured **as-is**, without interpretation or adjustment, following DGCP principles of **ground-truth data, traceability, and temporal integrity**.  
The timestamp embedded in the image serves as verifiable temporal evidence and forms part of **MaMeeFarm’s continuous real-work data archive**.

This proof is part of the official **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection on OpenSea:
