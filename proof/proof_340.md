## Description

This proof documents the morning observation of the **single remaining duck** at **MaMeeFarm**, recorded on  
**16 December 2025 at 06:56 AM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows one adult duck walking alone within the farm enclosure. Food remnants are visible on the ground, indicating normal feeding conditions. Despite regular care, **no egg was produced** this morning.

This record reflects a real-time livestock condition, captured **without assumption or projection**. The absence of egg production is documented as a **factual observation**, not interpreted as decline or recovery.

Such data is essential in real-work farming environments, where biological outcomes fluctuate due to age, stress, environmental change, or prior events. Recording both **presence and absence of expected outputs** is fundamental to DGCP principles, ensuring **completeness and honesty of data**.

This image is preserved as **ground-truth evidence**, with the embedded timestamp serving as verifiable temporal reference within **MaMeeFarm’s continuous proof system**.

This proof is part of the official **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection on OpenSea:
