## Description

This proof documents the **groundwater pumping activity** at **MaMeeFarm** for daily plant irrigation, recorded on  
**16 December 2025 at 10:02 AM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows water being actively pumped from a **ground well** into an open water container using a **small portable pump system**. The collected water is intended for irrigating trees and plants within the farm area. Surrounding vegetation indicates early signs of **seasonal dryness**, despite remaining greenery.

This activity reflects a real-world response to changing environmental conditions, as natural moisture begins to decrease and **manual water management** becomes necessary. The pumping process relies on **limited resources and direct labor**, without automated irrigation infrastructure.

This record is captured **as-is**, without optimization or staging, in accordance with DGCP principles of **transparency, real-work evidence, and time-anchored documentation**.  
The visible timestamp embedded in the image provides verifiable temporal reference within **MaMeeFarm’s continuous environmental and operational data archive**.

This proof is part of the official **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection on OpenSea:
