## Description

This proof documents a **midday rest period** at **MaMeeFarm**, recorded on  
**16 December 2025 at 12:58 PM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows **MaMee resting inside a simple bamboo shelter**, surrounded by farm tools, water containers, and vegetation. This pause in activity occurs during a period of **increased daytime heat**, following morning farm labor including **water pumping and animal care**.

The structure provides **basic shade without mechanical cooling or climate control**. This rest period represents a **necessary physiological response** to environmental conditions rather than inactivity or idleness.

Within real-world farming operations, **rest is an essential component of labor sustainability**, particularly under heat stress. This record captures the **human dimension of farm operations** as part of the DGCP™ real-work data system.

The image is recorded **as-is**, with a visible timestamp embedded, ensuring **temporal traceability and continuity** within **MaMeeFarm’s daily operational archive**.

This proof is part of the official **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection on OpenSea:
