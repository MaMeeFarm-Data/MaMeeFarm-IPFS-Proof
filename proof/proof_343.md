## Description

This proof documents a **manual weeding activity** performed at **MaMeeFarm**, recorded on  
**16 December 2025 at 02:52 PM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows **MaMee actively clearing grass and weeds around chili plants** using a hand tool. The work is conducted under natural daylight conditions, with surrounding banana trees and mixed vegetation visible within the farm area.

This activity represents continued farm labor following earlier irrigation and rest periods. Weed removal is a routine but essential task to reduce competition for water and nutrients, support plant health, and maintain usable growing space in small-scale farming environments.

The task is performed manually, without mechanized equipment or chemical herbicides, reflecting real-world constraints and direct human labor input.

This record is captured **as-is**, without staging or enhancement, in accordance with DGCP principles of **ground-truth documentation, transparency, and temporal accuracy**.  
The timestamp embedded in the image provides verifiable temporal evidence and maintains continuity within **MaMeeFarm’s daily operational proof archive**.

This proof is part of the official **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection on OpenSea:
