## Name

**Proof_344 — Duck Coop Temperature & Humidity Monitoring**

## Description

This proof documents the **initial environmental monitoring inside the duck coop** at
**MaMeeFarm**, recorded on **17 December 2025 at 07:48 AM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows a digital thermometer–hygrometer placed inside the duck shelter near
bedding material. The device displays an **indoor temperature of 18.0°C**, an
**external reference temperature of 18.5°C**, and **relative humidity of 90%**.

This record marks the beginning of systematic temperature and humidity tracking within
the duck coop environment. Such data is essential for understanding animal comfort,
respiratory conditions, bedding moisture, and overall livestock well-being in
small-scale farming systems.

The measurement is captured under natural conditions, without climate control or
artificial adjustment. This proof is recorded **as-is**, following DGCP principles of
ground-truth data, transparency, and temporal accuracy.

The embedded timestamp in the image provides verifiable temporal evidence and maintains
continuity within MaMeeFarm’s daily proof archive.

This proof is part of the official **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection on OpenSea and is
distributed via IPFS for immutable reference.
