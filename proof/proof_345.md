## Name

**Proof_345 — Morning Interaction With the Last Remaining Duck**

## Description

This proof documents a **morning human–animal interaction** at
**MaMeeFarm**, recorded on **17 December 2025 at 07:50 AM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows **MaMee sitting inside the duck coop and calmly interacting
with the single remaining duck**. Feeding containers are visible, and the
duck appears physically active and alert.

On this morning, **no egg was produced**, despite the duck showing **no
visible signs of illness or distress**.

This record captures both **presence and absence**: the presence of life,
care, and interaction, alongside the absence of expected production output.
Such dual documentation is essential for maintaining integrity in real-world
livestock data.

The observation is recorded **as-is**, without interpretation or projection,
in accordance with DGCP principles of ground-truth documentation,
transparency, and temporal accuracy.

The embedded timestamp in the image provides verifiable temporal evidence
and continuity within MaMeeFarm’s daily proof archive.

This proof is part of the official **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection on
OpenSea and is distributed via IPFS for immutable reference.
