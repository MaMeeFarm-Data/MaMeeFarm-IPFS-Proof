## Description

This proof documents a **morning banana tree pruning activity** at
**MaMeeFarm**, recorded on **17 December 2025 at 07:52 AM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows **MaMee actively trimming banana leaves** using a long manual
cutting tool. The activity is performed under natural daylight in an open farm
area, with surrounding fields, vegetation, and distant hills visible.

Banana leaf pruning is a routine but essential task to remove damaged or excess
leaves, reduce wind resistance, improve airflow, and maintain overall plant
health. This work supports long-term productivity and reduces disease risk
without the use of chemical inputs or mechanized equipment.

The activity reflects a consistent daily work rhythm, with labor beginning
early in the morning as part of MaMeeFarm’s real-world farming operations.

This record is captured **as-is**, without staging or enhancement, in
accordance with DGCP principles of ground-truth documentation, transparency,
and temporal accuracy.

The embedded timestamp in the image provides verifiable temporal evidence and
continuity within MaMeeFarm’s daily proof archive.

This proof is part of the official **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection on
OpenSea and is distributed via IPFS for immutable reference.
