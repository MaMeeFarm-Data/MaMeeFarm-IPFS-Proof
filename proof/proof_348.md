## Description

This proof documents a **midday water pumping activity** at **MaMeeFarm**,
recorded on **17 December 2025 at 01:48 PM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows water being actively pumped into large storage barrels under
strong sunlight. The stored water is intended for essential farm and household
use, including animal care, irrigation, and daily living requirements.

This activity takes place during extreme daytime heat, emphasizing the
necessity of securing water reserves despite physically demanding conditions.
The pumping system operates without automated infrastructure, relying on
direct human labor and basic mechanical equipment.

This record is captured **as-is**, without staging or optimization, in
accordance with DGCP principles of ground-truth documentation, transparency,
and temporal accuracy.

The embedded timestamp in the image provides verifiable temporal evidence and
maintains continuity within MaMeeFarm’s daily proof archive.

This proof is part of the official **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection on
OpenSea and is distributed via IPFS for immutable reference.
