# Proof_351 — Morning Check on the Last Remaining Duck
MaMeeFarm | DGCP™

---

## Description

This proof documents a **morning health and condition check of the last remaining duck** at **MaMeeFarm**, recorded on  
**18 December 2025 at 07:54 AM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows **MaMee observing and interacting with the single remaining duck inside the coop**. The duck is active, alert, and moving normally within the enclosure. No egg production was observed during this morning check.

This record captures a routine but meaningful farming activity, where **absence of output (no eggs)** is recorded as valid and truthful data, not as missing or failed information.

The proof reflects ongoing animal care and responsibility despite reduced livestock numbers. It demonstrates the human–animal relationship and the real conditions of small-scale farming operations.

The record is captured **as-is**, without staging or enhancement, in alignment with DGCP principles of **ground-truth documentation, transparency, and temporal traceability**.  
A visible timestamp embedded in the image ensures verifiable continuity within **MaMeeFarm’s daily operational archive**.

This proof is part of the **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection and is distributed via IPFS (ipfs.io) for immutable reference.
