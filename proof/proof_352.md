MaMeeFarm | DGCP™

---

## Description

This proof documents morning farm labor focused on clearing and cutting vegetation in the banana garden area at MaMeeFarm, recorded on **18 December 2025 at 08:00 AM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows MaMee standing in the back area of the farm near banana plants, holding a long manual cutting tool. Trimmed banana leaves and cleared ground vegetation indicate active maintenance work.

This activity supports basic farm operations by reducing overgrowth, improving accessibility, and maintaining usable space around productive plants. The work is performed manually under natural daylight conditions without mechanized equipment.

This record is captured as-is, without staging or enhancement, in accordance with DGCP principles of ground-truth documentation, transparency, and temporal accuracy. The embedded timestamp in the image provides verifiable temporal evidence and continuity within MaMeeFarm’s daily operational archive.

This proof is part of the **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection and is distributed via IPFS (ipfs.io), supporting immutable reference and long-term data integrity.
