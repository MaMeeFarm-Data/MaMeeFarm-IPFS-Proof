MaMeeFarm | DGCP™

---

## Description

This proof documents a midday cooking activity at MaMeeFarm, recorded on **18 December 2025 at 11:30 AM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows MaMee cooking rice using a traditional wood-fired stove to provide food for all lives on the farm, including humans and animals. Firewood prepared earlier is used as fuel, reflecting a self-reliant and resource-conscious way of living.

Cooking is treated as essential farm labor, directly linked to survival, care, and daily continuity within the farm ecosystem. This activity represents real work that sustains both people and animals, beyond visible agricultural production.

This record is captured as-is, without staging or enhancement, in accordance with DGCP principles of ground-truth documentation, transparency, and temporal accuracy. The embedded timestamp in the image provides verifiable temporal evidence and continuity within MaMeeFarm’s daily operational archive.

This proof is part of the **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection and is distributed via IPFS (ipfs.io), supporting immutable reference, auditability, and long-term data integrity.
