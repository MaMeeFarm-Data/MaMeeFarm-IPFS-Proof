## Description

This proof documents the **morning environmental conditions before the start of daily farm work** at **MaMeeFarm**, recorded on  
**19 December 2025 at 07:31 AM (GMT+7)**.

The image captures a digital thermometer and humidity meter installed at the farm, displaying **ambient temperature and humidity levels** prior to any physical labor or animal care activities.

Recording environmental data before daily operations provides verified baseline context for:
- Human working conditions  
- Animal welfare assessment  
- Agricultural decision-making  
- Long-term climate and farm data analysis  

This record intentionally captures real-world conditions **as-is**, without adjustment, staging, or interpretation. The visible timestamp embedded in the image ensures **temporal traceability and audit integrity**, fully aligned with DGCP ground-truth principles.

This proof has been minted as an NFT on OpenSea and serves as an immutable reference within the DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA archive.
