## Name

**Proof_355 — Empty Duck Coop After Final Duck Disappearance**  
MaMeeFarm | DGCP™

## Description

This proof documents a **critical state-change event** at **MaMeeFarm**, recorded on  
**19 December 2025 at 07:58 AM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows an **empty duck coop**, marking the moment when **the final remaining duck has disappeared from the farm**. As of this record, **MaMeeFarm has no ducks present**.

This proof captures **absence as verifiable ground-truth data**. The empty feeding areas, cleared ground, and intact coop structure collectively serve as evidence of a real-world condition change, not a symbolic or narrative claim.

Within the DGCP framework, **non-production, interruption, loss, or absence** are treated as valid and essential data states. Recording this moment preserves continuity and prevents retrospective distortion of farm history.

The image is recorded **as-is**, without staging, reenactment, or enhancement.  
The embedded timestamp provides **verifiable temporal anchoring**, ensuring traceability within MaMeeFarm’s continuous operational archive.

This proof is part of the official **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection on OpenSea and is referenced via **IPFS (ipfs.io)** for immutable and auditable access.
