## Name

**Proof_356 — Village Food Purchase After 3 km Walk**  
MaMeeFarm | DGCP™

## Description

This proof documents a **daily subsistence activity** at **MaMeeFarm**, recorded on  
**19 December 2025 at 09:26 AM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows **MaMee returning from a local village shop carrying food supplies**, including fresh fish and household provisions. The round trip walking distance is approximately **3 kilometers**, completed entirely on foot.

This activity reflects real-world living conditions where access to food requires physical movement and time investment, rather than reliance on digital ordering or motorized transport. Such routines form a fundamental layer of daily survival logistics in small-scale rural life.

Within the DGCP framework, **daily mobility, energy expenditure, and food acquisition** are recognized as valid ground-truth data. This proof captures not only the purchased items, but also the human effort required to sustain the household and farm ecosystem.

The image is recorded **as-is**, without staging, reenactment, or enhancement.  
The embedded timestamp provides verifiable temporal anchoring and maintains continuity within MaMeeFarm’s real-work data archive.

This proof is part of the official **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection on OpenSea and is referenced via **IPFS (ipfs.io)** to ensure immutability, auditability, and long-term preservation.
