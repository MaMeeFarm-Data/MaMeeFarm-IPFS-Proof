## Description

This proof documents the condition of a **hybrid solar inverter** installed at **MaMeeFarm**, recorded on  
**19 December 2025 at 11:13 AM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows a solar inverter connected to the farm’s photovoltaic system. The unit has been in operation for approximately **seven years**. While the inverter remains connected and part of the active energy infrastructure, its **display panel is no longer functioning**, preventing direct visibility of operational metrics.

Due to ongoing financial limitations, replacement or repair has not yet been possible. This condition reflects the real-world constraints faced by small-scale farms that rely on aging infrastructure beyond its intended service lifecycle.

Under the DGCP framework, **equipment degradation, delayed maintenance, and infrastructure limitations** are treated as valid ground-truth data rather than anomalies. This proof records not only the physical state of the device but also the economic context influencing continued use.

The image is recorded **as-is**, without modification, repair, or staging.  
A visible timestamp embedded in the image ensures temporal traceability and continuity within **MaMeeFarm’s daily operational proof archive**.

This proof is part of the official **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection published on OpenSea and distributed via **IPFS (ipfs.io)** for long-term auditability.
