## Description

This proof documents a moment of **food sharing within MaMeeFarm**, recorded on  
**19 December 2025 at 11:13 AM (GMT+7)**.

The image shows **papaya harvested directly from the MaMeeFarm garden**, being prepared and shared among **humans and dogs living together within the farm household**. The papaya is cut into pieces and placed on simple plates for immediate consumption.

This activity reflects **subsistence living and resource sharing**, where food grown on-site is used directly to sustain all lives within the farm ecosystem. No commercial intent, staging, or presentation is involved. The act represents everyday survival, care, and coexistence between humans and animals.

Within the DGCP framework, **daily nourishment, food preparation, and sharing behaviors** are valid ground-truth events. They provide insight into real-world living conditions, food security, and interspecies relationships in small-scale farming environments.

The record is captured **as-is**, without enhancement or modification. The embedded timestamp in the image provides verifiable temporal evidence and maintains continuity within **MaMeeFarm’s daily operational proof archive**.

This proof is part of the official **DGCP MaMeeFarm DATA** collection and is distributed via IPFS to ensure long-term traceability and auditability.
