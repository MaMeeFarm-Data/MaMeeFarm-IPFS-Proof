## Context

This proof records the morning inspection of the duck coop at MaMeeFarm.
At the time of recording, **no ducks remain alive or present in the coop**.

Despite the absence of animals, the inspection routine continues as part of
daily responsibility, memory, and discipline accumulated over years of farm life.

This action is not driven by productivity, profit, or external validation,
but by continuity of care and accountability to reality.

## Description of Activity

- The duck coop is structurally intact.
- Feeding containers and water basins remain in place.
- No movement, sound, or biological activity is detected.
- The ground shows signs of previous use but no current occupation.

The inspection is performed manually by MaMee, following the same routine
as when ducks were present.

---

## Significance

This proof documents **absence as data**.

In conventional systems, empty spaces generate no value.
Within the DGCP framework, absence itself becomes a verifiable state of reality,
anchored in time, place, and human action.

The act of continuing to inspect an empty coop demonstrates:

- Persistence without reward  
- Labor without recognition  
- Data without institutional permission  

This proof exists to preserve truth, not to persuade.
