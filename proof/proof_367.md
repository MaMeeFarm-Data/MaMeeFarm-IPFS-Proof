MaMeeFarm into the nearby village to purchase pork as a basic source of protein.

The total cost of the purchase was **30 Thai Baht**, intended to provide food
for the entire day.

This activity reflects subsistence-level decision making under limited
resources, where distance, cost, and physical effort are integral parts
of daily survival.

## Significance

This proof captures **human labor beyond employment**.

In many economic systems, walking to purchase food is invisible and unrecorded.
Within the DGCP framework, the effort, distance, and decision-making process
are preserved as verifiable data.

The proof highlights:

- Cost-constrained nutrition planning  
- Physical labor embedded in daily life  
- Survival logic at the microeconomic level  

This data exists not to dramatize hardship, but to preserve factual reality.
