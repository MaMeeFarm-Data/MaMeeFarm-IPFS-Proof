## Context

This proof documents the preparation of food at MaMeeFarm,
where pork previously purchased was cooked and intentionally
divided into **two meals** — lunch and dinner.

The action reflects careful resource management under limited
conditions, ensuring nutritional continuity throughout the day.

---

## Description of Activity

- Pork was prepared using basic cooking equipment.
- The meal was cooked once and divided into two portions.
- One portion was allocated for lunch.
- One portion was reserved for the evening meal.
- Cooking was done manually, without electrical kitchen appliances.

This activity demonstrates practical decision-making to
maximize limited food resources.

## Significance

This proof represents **invisible domestic labor** that is rarely
recognized as economic activity.

Within the DGCP framework, food preparation is treated as
real work because it involves:

- Time investment  
- Energy expenditure  
- Resource optimization  
- Survival planning  

The act of dividing food into multiple meals is a data point
reflecting micro-level resilience and sustainability.
