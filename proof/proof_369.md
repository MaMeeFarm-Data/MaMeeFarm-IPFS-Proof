# Proof_369 — Morning Weather Observation Before Work
MaMeeFarm | DGCP™

## Description
This proof documents the **start of the working day** at MaMeeFarm on  
**22 December 2025 at 06:50 AM (GMT+7)** through a direct weather observation.

The recorded temperature and humidity reflect early-morning environmental conditions before any physical labor begins. Such measurements are essential ground-truth indicators for farm work planning, crop care, and human endurance in non-industrial farming environments.

The data is captured directly from a physical device without modification, automation, or optimization.

This proof preserves **environmental reality before action**, forming a baseline record for the day.

## Significance
Weather data represents uncontrollable external conditions that directly affect labor capacity and productivity. Recording it daily establishes temporal continuity and environmental truth.

## Activity Classification
- Environmental Observation
- Daily Baseline Record
