# DGCP Proof 419 — Morning Temperature Check Before Work

## Context
This proof documents the morning temperature and humidity measurement at MaMeeFarm™
on January 1, 2026, before the start of daily work activities.

The image shows a digital thermometer/hygrometer device mounted against a brick wall,
displaying environmental conditions at the farm.

## Description
On 2026-01-01 at 06:56 (local time), MaMeeFarm™ recorded ambient environmental data
prior to commencing daily operations.

Measured values:
- Temperature: 15.9°C
- Humidity: 72%

This measurement reflects early-morning cold conditions at the farm location.

## Significance
Environmental measurements form a baseline layer of DGCP evidence.
They provide verifiable context for physical labor conditions, energy usage,
and operational constraints experienced during real work.

This proof establishes traceable environmental ground truth for the day.
