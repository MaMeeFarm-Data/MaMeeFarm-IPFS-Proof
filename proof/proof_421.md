# DGCP Proof 421 — Empty Duck Coop on New Year Day

## Context
This proof documents the empty duck coop at MaMeeFarm™ on the first day of the new year.

No animals were present in the structure at the time of recording.

## Description
On 2026-01-01 at 07:47, MaMeeFarm™ recorded the condition of the duck coop,
which remained empty and unchanged.

The record intentionally captures the absence of activity as part of continuous
evidence keeping.

## Significance
DGCP recognizes absence as valid data.
Recording periods with no production or livestock establishes transparency
and prevents retrospective narrative manipulation.

This proof reinforces continuity and honesty in daily records.
