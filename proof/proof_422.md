# DGCP Proof 422 — Inverter Activation for Household Work

## Context
This proof documents the activation of the hybrid solar inverter system
used to supply electricity to the household workspace at MaMeeFarm™.

## Description
On 2026-01-01 at 08:04, MaMeeFarm™ activated the inverter system to enable
limited working hours for digital and household tasks.

The system operates under time constraints due to limited energy storage capacity,
with usage typically restricted between 08:00 and 23:00.

## Significance
This proof records operational constraints and energy limitations as part
of real-world working conditions.

DGCP captures not only outputs, but also infrastructure boundaries
that shape productivity and decision-making.
