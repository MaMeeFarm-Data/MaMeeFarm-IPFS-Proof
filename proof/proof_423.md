# DGCP Proof 423 — Fuel Preparation for Grass Cutting

## Context
This proof documents the preparation of fuel for grass-cutting equipment
used in routine farm maintenance at MaMeeFarm™.

## Description
On 2026-01-01 at 11:09, MaMeeFarm™ prepared fuel and equipment
in anticipation of grass-cutting activities within the farm.

The image captures fuel containers, lubricant, and small-engine equipment
prior to operation.

## Significance
Preparatory actions are a critical but often invisible layer of real work.
DGCP records these steps to preserve a complete chain of causality
from preparation to execution.

This proof establishes readiness and resource allocation as verifiable evidence.
