# Proof 458 — DGCP Daily Evidence

Date: 2026-01-08  
Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)  
Proof ID: 458  

## Context
Meal preparation using farm-grown vegetables and limited purchased ingredients, reflecting cost-controlled survival operations.

## Description
This proof documents a prepared meal using vegetables harvested earlier (referenced from Proof 456).  
Additional details recorded by the operator:
- Minced pork purchased at cost: 30 THB per purchase
- Portioning strategy: cooked to cover ~2 days, divided into 4 meal sets
- Vegetables sourced from the farm garden (kale from Proof 456)
- Separate meal allocation: an additional set prepared for P’Toh, with different vegetables (P’To does not eat kale)
- Purpose: sustain labor and keep the operational system running under constraints

- Time of capture (local): 2026-01-08 14:12  
- Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  
- Capture method: Direct photography (real environment)

## Significance
Provides traceable linkage between harvest (Proof 456) and consumption (Proof 458), documenting real cost control, rationing, and operational resilience under limited resources.
