Proof ID: 461  

## Context
This proof documents incremental manual labor performed within an unused duck coop area at MaMeeFarm.

Although the coop is currently empty, maintenance and land preparation continue as part of long-term farm sustainability. Work is intentionally paced and adjusted to physical capacity, reflecting realistic labor conditions.

## Description
The image records MaMee conducting soil and ground work inside an empty duck coop zone.  
The activity involves gradual clearing and preparation of the area, completed one section per day according to available strength and health considerations.

This work demonstrates continuity of labor even in the absence of animals or immediate production.

No staging, reenactment, or external intervention occurred.
