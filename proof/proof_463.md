Date: 2026-01-09  
Location: MaMeeFarm, Thailand  
Framework: DGCP (Data Governance & Continuous Proof)  
Proof ID: 463  

## Context
This proof documents the completion step of daily animal care related to dog bedding management at MaMeeFarm.

After sun-drying during the day, bedding materials must be collected before evening to prevent moisture absorption from nighttime dew, which would lead to dampness and hygiene issues.

This proof directly references the morning drying activity recorded in Proof 460.

## Description
The image records the act of collecting dog bedding in the late afternoon after it has been dried in sunlight throughout the day.

The bedding is gathered before 17:00 to avoid evening dew formation.  
This task completes a full daily care cycle consisting of:
- Morning drying (Proof 460)
- Evening collection (Proof 463)

The activity reflects time-sensitive decision-making and routine labor continuity.

No staging, reenactment, or external intervention occurred.
