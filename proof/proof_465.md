Date: 2026-01-10  
Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP  
Proof ID: 465  

## Context
Land-use transition in an empty duck coop area.

## Description
This proof documents preparation of a new vegetable planting area in a previously empty duck coop zone.

The area was cleared after removing basil plants recorded earlier in the dataset  
(reference: DGCP Data Units 00127–00128).

The activity reflects adaptive land use following changes in livestock presence and resource availability.

No planting is shown at this stage.  
This proof records the condition of the soil and area prior to the next planting phase.
