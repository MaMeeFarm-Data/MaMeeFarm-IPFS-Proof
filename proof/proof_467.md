# Proof 467 — Walking to Village for Food Procurement

Date: 2026-01-10  
Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP  
Proof ID: 467  

## Context
Food access under transportation constraints.

## Description
This proof documents the outbound walk from MaMeeFarm into the village to purchase food.

At the time of capture, household food supplies were depleted while farm tasks were partially completed.

The route requires walking nearly 3 kilometers one way, due to the absence of a vehicle.

This activity reflects physical effort and time investment required to secure basic necessities.
