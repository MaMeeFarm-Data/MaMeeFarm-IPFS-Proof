# DGCP Proof 471 — Manual Watering Tool and Water Usage Measurement

## Context
This proof documents water usage during manual vegetable watering at MaMeeFarm.

## Description
The image shows a 4-liter watering can used to irrigate a vegetable bed approximately 1.5 meters long and 60 centimeters wide.  
Each bed receives two full watering cycles, totaling approximately 8 liters per watering session.

This activity reflects manual water management based on observation and repetition rather than automated irrigation systems.  
The practice has been repeated daily and is referenced against DGCP Data Unit 00167 to establish consistency.

## Significance
- Records quantitative water usage in manual agriculture  
- Demonstrates resource management under infrastructure constraints  
- Supports repeatability and measurement in real-world farming  

## Activity Classification
- Category: Daily Labor  
- Subcategory: Water Management  
- Energy Dependency: Human labor
