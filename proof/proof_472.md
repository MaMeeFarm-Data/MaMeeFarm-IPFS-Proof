# DGCP Proof 472 — Weed Clearing Around Papaya Tree

## Context
This proof documents weed removal around a papaya tree at MaMeeFarm.

## Description
The image shows a papaya tree after weeds surrounding its base were cleared.  
Although the tree has begun flowering, stem growth was limited due to dense weed competition.

Manual weed removal was performed to reduce nutrient competition and improve plant development.  
The image reflects post-clearing conditions, documenting the intervention outcome.

## Significance
