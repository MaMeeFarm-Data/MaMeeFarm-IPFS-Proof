# DGCP Proof 473 — Firewood Preparation and Sun-Drying

## Context
This proof documents preparation of firewood for daily cooking fuel at MaMeeFarm.

## Description
The image records manual breaking and placement of firewood in an open sunlight corridor to allow natural drying.  
Sun exposure is used to reduce moisture content, improving combustion efficiency for cooking.

This activity reflects reliance on biomass energy under limited electricity availability and follows repeated fuel preparation practices referenced in DGCP Data Unit 00176.

No machinery or external energy sources were used; all labor was manual.

## Significance
- Documents non-electric energy preparation  
- Demonstrates sustainable biomass fuel management  
- Contributes to evidence of energy resilience  

## Activity Classification
- Category: Energy Preparation  
- Subcategory: Biomass Fuel Management  
- Energy Dependency: Human labor and sunlight
