## DGCP MaMeeFarm Proof 506

## Title
Solar Inverter Status During Daily Internet and Work Activation

## Description
This proof documents the operational condition of the farm’s hybrid solar inverter during the morning activation of internet connectivity and daily work processes at MaMeeFarm.
The inverter display was non-functional due to long-term hardware degradation after approximately seven years of continuous use.
Despite the degraded display condition, the system remained operational and was used to support essential daily activities under energy and infrastructure constraints.

## Context (Factual)
- Date (Local): 2026-01-18
- Time (Local): 08:00
- Location: MaMeeFarm, Thailand
- System: Hybrid Solar Inverter
- Hardware Condition: Display not functioning (degradation from long-term use)
- Operational Status: System active and in use
- Energy Source: Solar-based off-grid system
- Constraint Type: Energy availability and aging hardware

## Operational Purpose
- Internet activation for daily work
