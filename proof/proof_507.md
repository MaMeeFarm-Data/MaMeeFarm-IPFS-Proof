## DGCP MaMeeFarm Proof 507

### Context
This proof documents an evening vegetable watering activity conducted at MaMeeFarm.
The activity was performed during late-day hours as part of routine farm maintenance to preserve soil moisture and plant health.

The operation was carried out manually under limited water and energy conditions, reflecting real-world agricultural constraints and time-based labor management.

### Description
The evidence captures a farm operator watering vegetable plots using basic manual equipment.
This activity represents daily labor necessary to sustain food production in small-scale farming environments.

The work was conducted in the evening to reduce water loss from evaporation and to align with physical capacity and environmental conditions.

### Significance
This record demonstrates continuity of farm operations through consistent daily labor despite resource limitations.
It provides verifiable ground-truth evidence of agricultural work, human effort, and adaptive resource management under real-life constraints.

The proof contributes to long-term traceability of food production practices and labor realities within the DGCP framework.
