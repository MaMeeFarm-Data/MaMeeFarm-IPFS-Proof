## Description
This proof documents the cutting of a banana tree as part of harvest
and crop lifecycle management at MaMeeFarm.

The banana tree recorded in this proof was previously documented
in Proof 412 and relates to ripening observations and harvest timing.

Harvest decision on this date was informed by ripening status
observed from earlier data units, including initial cutting
and subsequent maturation stages.
