## Title
Morning Banana Distribution to Dogs (From Farm Harvest)

## Context
This proof documents a morning farm-management activity: distributing ripe bananas to the farm’s dogs as part of daily feeding and resource allocation.
The bananas originate from the farm harvest previously recorded as **DataUnit 00104** (cut date: 2026-01-08).
Current farm members at the time of this proof: **2 human workers, 20 dogs, 0 ducks**.

## Description
At the recorded time, ripe bananas from the farm were portioned and distributed to the dogs in the home zone.
This activity reflects daily caregiving and on-site food utilization under operational constraints.
No narrative interpretation is added; this record captures the observable management action and its supporting reference(s).
