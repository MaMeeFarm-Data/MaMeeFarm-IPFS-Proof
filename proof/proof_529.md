Proof ID: 529  
Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP  
Date (Local): 2026-01-23  
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  

## Description
Human labor activity recorded in the early morning.
A routine daily farm operation where a human worker exits the house and begins regular farm work.

This record documents ordinary, recurring labor performed under real-world conditions,
without staging, optimization, or simulation.

## Context
- Activity type: Daily farm labor
- Time of capture: Morning
- Environment: Open farm area, routine access gate
- Nature of work: Non-specialized, habitual maintenance and operation

## Significance
This proof reinforces continuous human presence and labor continuity within the MaMeeFarm™ system.
Routine actions are treated as first-class evidence, ensuring that long-term datasets reflect
real human work rather than curated highlights.
