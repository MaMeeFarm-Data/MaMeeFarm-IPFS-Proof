# DGCP Proof Record

Proof ID: 530  
Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP  
Date (Local): 2026-01-23  
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  

## Description
Human labor activity involving manual watering of a newly planted eggplant plot.
At the time of this record, the eggplant seedlings had not yet emerged above soil level.

This action reflects routine care and continuity of agricultural labor,
performed regardless of immediate visible results.

## Context
- Crop: Eggplant
- Plot status: Seeded, no visible sprouting
- Reference planting record: DataUnit 00229 (planted on 2026-01-13)
- Activity type: Manual irrigation
- Time of capture: Morning
- Environment: Open-field garden plot

## Significance
This proof documents pre-emergence care, emphasizing that agricultural labor
is recorded independent of visible growth or outcome. The record reinforces
DGCP principles by capturing effort, time, and intent under real-world conditions,
rather than only successful or visually evident results.
