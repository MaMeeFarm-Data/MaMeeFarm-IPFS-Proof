# DGCP Proof 533 — Mobile Water Tank Depleted Due to Insufficient Solar Power

Date (Local): 2026-01-23  
Time (Local): 17:47  
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  
Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP  

## Context
This proof documents the depletion status of a mobile water tank
used in farm operations, under real-world solar energy constraints.

## Asset Identification
- Asset ID: WT-M-0001
- Type: Water Tank
- Capacity: 200 L
- System: Mobile
- Status: Active

## Observation
The water tank was observed to be empty at the time of inspection.
Water pumping could not be performed due to insufficient sunlight,
resulting in unavailable solar power.

## Environmental & System Reference
- Solar condition: No sufficient sunlight for pumping
- Referenced solar/environmental DataUnits:
  - DataUnit 00552
  - DataUnit 00554

## Last Recorded Refill Reference
- DataUnit 00462
- Date: 2026-01-20

## Evidence
- Image captured showing empty water tank interior.
- Timestamp embedded in image.

## Integrity Notes
This record reflects an operational constraint caused by
environmental dependency on solar energy.
No corrective action was performed at the time of capture.
