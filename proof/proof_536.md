## Description
Hybrid solar inverter system was powered on again
to restore electrical operation under limited energy conditions.

This action reflects a repeated system start attempt
performed due to low available solar input.

---

## System Context
- Device: Hybrid Solar Inverter
- Operating Condition: Low solar input
- Constraint: Limited electrical availability

---

## Reference
- Initial inverter operation:
  - DataUnit 00578
  - DataUnit 00579
- Low solar condition:
  - DataUnit 00577
