# DGCP Proof 541 — Water Pump Preparation During Stable Solar Power Window

Date (Local): 2026-01-25  
Time (Local): 11:17  
Operational Window: 11:00–14:00  
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  
Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP  

## Context
This proof documents preparation of the water pumping system
during a time window with stable solar power availability.

## Activity
The water pump was prepared and positioned for operation
during midday hours when solar energy output was sufficient
for stable electrical supply.

## Power Condition
Electrical stability was achieved through the farm’s
solar power system during the stated operational window.

## Notes
This proof records system readiness prior to water pumping
under real operational energy constraints.
