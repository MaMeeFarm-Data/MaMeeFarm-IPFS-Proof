# DGCP Proof 544 — Zone Identification Label Installed (Front Yard)

Date (Local): 2026-01-26
Time (Local): 07:51
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok

Project: MaMeeFarm™
Framework: DGCP

## Context
This proof documents the physical installation and identification of a zone label
used to define and segment operational areas within the MaMeeFarm™ property.
The labeling supports spatial traceability and system-level organization.

## Zone Identification
- Zone ID: HZ-01
- Zone Name: Front Yard Strip
- System Association: House Line
- Zone Type: Infrastructure / Utility Boundary
- Label Format: Physical sticker with printed identifier

## Observation
A zone label marked "HZ-01 — Front Yard Strip" was observed affixed to a
structural surface within the front yard area.
The label explicitly associates the zone with the House Line system,
indicating separation from farm-line and mobile systems.

This zone functions as a reference boundary for house-level utilities
and front-yard operations.

## Significance
Zone-level identification enables consistent spatial reference across
Proofs, Data Units, and infrastructure records.
This supports long-term traceability, system auditing, and non-ambiguous
mapping between physical space and recorded data.

## Activity Classification
- Category: Infrastructure
- Subcategory: Zone Definition / Spatial Labeling
- Operation Type: Physical Identification (Non-Destructive)
