# DGCP Proof 545 — Zone Identification Label Installed (Duck & Vegetable Zone A)

Date (Local): 2026-01-26
Time (Local): 13:11
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok

Project: MaMeeFarm™
Framework: DGCP

## Context
This proof documents the physical identification and confirmation of a
farm operational zone through the installation of a zone label.
The purpose is to establish a clear, auditable spatial boundary for
animal and crop activities under the DGCP framework.

## Zone Identification
- Zone ID: FZ-03
- Zone Name: Duck & Vegetable Zone A
- System Association: Farm
- Scope:
  - Ducks
  - Primary Vegetable Beds
- Zone Type: Agricultural Production Zone
- Label Format: Physical sticker with printed identifier

## Observation
A zone label marked "FZ-03 — Duck & Vegetable Zone A" was observed affixed
to a structural surface within the farm area.
The label explicitly associates this zone with the Farm system and
defines its scope as duck activity and primary vegetable beds.

This zone represents an integrated production area where animal presence
and vegetable cultivation coexist under daily farm operations.

## Significance
The establishment of Zone FZ-03 provides a stable spatial reference for
linking future Proofs, Data Units, and operational records involving
ducks and vegetable production.

Zone-level definition strengthens traceability, reduces ambiguity in
data interpretation, and supports long-term verification of farm
activities under DGCP.
