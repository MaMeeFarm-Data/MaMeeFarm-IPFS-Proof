# DGCP Proof 546 — Zone Identification Label Installed (Vegetable Zone B)

Date (Local): 2026-01-26
Time (Local): 13:12
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok

Project: MaMeeFarm™
Framework: DGCP

## Context
This proof documents the physical identification of a secondary
agricultural zone within MaMeeFarm™ through the installation of a
zone label.

The purpose is to establish a clear spatial boundary for secondary
crop activities under the DGCP framework.

## Zone Identification
- Zone ID: FZ-04
- Zone Name: Vegetable Zone B
- System Association: Farm
- Scope: Secondary Crop Area
- Zone Type: Agricultural Production Zone (Secondary)
- Label Format: Physical sticker with printed identifier

## Observation
A zone label marked "FZ-04 — Vegetable Zone B" was observed affixed to
a tree trunk within the farm area.

The label explicitly associates this zone with the Farm system and
defines its scope as a secondary crop area, distinct from primary
vegetable beds and duck-integrated zones.

## Significance
The definition of Zone FZ-04 establishes a verifiable spatial reference
for secondary crop activities.

This separation enables clearer traceability between primary and
secondary production areas, supporting accurate data linkage and
future audits within the DGCP system.
