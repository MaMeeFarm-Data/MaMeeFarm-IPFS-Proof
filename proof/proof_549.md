# Proof 549 – Farm Gate Opening for Daily Operations

## Context
This proof documents the opening of the farm gate to begin daily farm operations at MaMeeFarm™, specifically accessing Farm Zones FZ-03 and FZ-04.

The activity represents a routine but essential transition point between the residential area and active farm labor zones, marking the start of real-world operations under the DGCP™ continuous proof system.

## Description
The visual record shows the farm gate opened in the early morning, providing access to cultivated land and working areas within FZ-03 and FZ-04.

This action is part of normal farm workflow and establishes a clear temporal and physical reference for subsequent activities recorded during the same operational window.

## Significance
Although simple, gate opening serves as a verifiable boundary event that anchors subsequent labor, movement, and environmental interactions within the farm system.

Such boundary proofs strengthen traceability by providing a clear start point for daily operational sequences.
