# Proof 550 – Home Inverter Activation under Power Constraints

## Context
This proof documents the activation of the hybrid solar inverter to restore electrical power within the residential area of MaMeeFarm™, specifically Home Zone HZ-02.

The event reflects routine system management under constrained energy availability and is part of continuous real-world operations recorded through the DGCP™ framework.

## Description
The visual record shows the hybrid solar inverter being powered on in the morning to resume household electrical supply.

The system operates under limited energy conditions, consistent with solar-dependent power availability and prior shutdown state.
