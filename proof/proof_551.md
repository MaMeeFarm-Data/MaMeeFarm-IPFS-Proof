# Proof 551 – Water Pump Preparation and Activation for Farm Zones

## Context
This proof documents the preparation and initiation of water pumping operations to Farm Zones FZ-03 and FZ-04 at MaMeeFarm™.

The activity reflects a transition from system readiness to active water distribution, following prior energy system activation under constrained power conditions.

## Description
The visual record shows the water pump positioned between water storage tanks, connected via hose and power supply, marking the start of pumping operations.

This event represents the operational beginning of water transfer toward agricultural zones FZ-03 and FZ-04.

## Significance
This proof establishes a verifiable start point for water distribution activities under real-world constraints.

Recording the initiation of pumping operations enables traceability of water flow, resource usage, and dependency on limited energy availability within the farm system.
