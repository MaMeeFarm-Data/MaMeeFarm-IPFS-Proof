# Proof 552 – Water Tank WT-M-0003 Filled to Capacity

## Context
This proof documents the completion of water pumping operations resulting in a full water level at Mobile Water Tank WT-M-0003 within MaMeeFarm™.

The event follows the initiation of water pumping activities toward Farm Zones FZ-03 and FZ-04.

## Description
The visual record shows Mobile Water Tank WT-M-0003 filled with water, with the inlet hose still present, confirming the completion state of the pumping cycle.

This proof marks the transition from active pumping to water availability for subsequent farm use.
