# Proof 553 – Farm Gate Closure After Daily Operations

## Context
This proof documents the closure of the farm gate after completion of daily farm operations at MaMeeFarm™, covering Farm Zones FZ-03 and FZ-04.

The event serves as an end-of-day boundary marker, completing the operational cycle that began with gate opening earlier the same day.

## Description
The visual record shows the farm gate in a closed state during late afternoon, indicating completion of work activities and restricted access to the farm zones for the remainder of the day.
