# Proof 555 – Power System Activation under Resource Constraints

## Context
This proof documents the activation of the farm power system at MaMeeFarm™,
operating under limited energy availability.

The system remains functional and supports ongoing operations despite
resource constraints inherent to solar-based power generation.

## Description
The visual record shows the hybrid solar inverter in active operation,
with asset identification labels clearly visible.

The system converts DC power from the solar panel array into AC power
for farm and residential use.
