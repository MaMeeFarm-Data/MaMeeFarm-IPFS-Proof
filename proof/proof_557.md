# Proof 557 – Banana Inflorescence Cut and Observation Start (BAN-0003)

## Context
This proof documents the cutting of the banana inflorescence and the initiation
of lifecycle observation for banana plant asset BAN-0003 at MaMeeFarm™.

The event marks the beginning of formal tracking for this specific banana plant
within the DGCP™ system.
