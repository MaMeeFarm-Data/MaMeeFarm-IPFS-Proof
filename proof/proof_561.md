# Proof 561 – Data Label Installation for Banana Asset BAN-0003 (FZ-03)

## Context
This proof documents the installation of structured data labels on a
banana plant asset as part of the DGCP traceability system at MaMeeFarm™.

The labeling establishes permanent linkage between the physical plant,
its primary biological event, and a derived biological asset.

## Description
The visual record shows DGCP data labels physically attached to
Banana Plant ID BAN-0003.

The labels include:
- Asset identity and classification
- Zone designation
- Primary biological event
- Derived biological asset reference
- Cross-links to Proof and Data Unit records

Label details (as shown on-site):

**Plant Identity**
- Plant ID: BAN-0003  
- Plant Type: Banana (Perennial Plant)

## Significance
This proof anchors biological events to a physical asset using
human-readable, on-site labels, ensuring that plant history and derived
assets remain verifiable without reliance on digital systems.

The labeling forms a durable bridge between physical reality and
cryptographically verifiable records within the DGCP™ framework.
