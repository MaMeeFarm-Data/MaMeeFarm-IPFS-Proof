# Proof 563 – Selective Sucker Removal for Banana Asset BAN-0001 (FZ-03)

## Context
This proof documents a banana plant maintenance activity conducted at
MaMeeFarm™, involving selective removal of banana suckers to maintain
optimal plant structure and productivity.

The activity applies to Banana Asset BAN-0001 and follows its previously
recorded biological and care events.

## Description
The visual record shows banana suckers removed, leaving three main stems
intentionally preserved.

This action is part of routine plant management to control growth density
and support healthy development of remaining banana plants.
