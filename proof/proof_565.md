# Proof 565 — Banana Asset Label Attachment for BAN-0001

## Context
This proof records the physical attachment of an identification label
to a banana plant under the DGCP asset system at MaMeeFarm™.

The action establishes visible, on-site linkage between the physical
banana asset and its corresponding digital identity records.

## Description
On 2026-01-30 at 07:38 (local time), Mamee is documented attaching an
identification label to a banana plant associated with asset BAN-0001
in zone FZ-03.

The image captures the moment of label attachment directly onto the
banana trunk, confirming that the asset is physically tagged in the
real-world environment.

- Actor: Mamee (in image)
- Recorder: P’Toh
- Asset: Banana (BAN-0001)
- Zone: FZ-03
- Activity: Asset labeling / identity attachment
- Time reference: 2026-01-30 07:38 (local)

This proof follows the selective sucker removal activity recorded in
Proof 563 and serves as a confirmation step to preserve asset identity
after structural modification.

## Significance
This record confirms:
- Physical-to-digital asset linkage
- Continuity of banana asset identity after maintenance activity
- Human-executed labeling as part of DGCP traceability practice

The proof strengthens the integrity of the banana asset record by
making the identity visible and verifiable on-site.
