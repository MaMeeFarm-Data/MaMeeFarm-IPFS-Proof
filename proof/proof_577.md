# Proof 577 — Inverter System Labeling (Solar Power)

Date (Local): 2026-02-01  
Time (Local): 13:29  
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  
Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP  
Proof ID: 577  

## Evidence Summary
This proof documents the physical labeling and system identification
of the farm solar power inverter and its associated energy components.
The activity establishes clear traceability between power generation,
conversion, storage, and farm system usage.

## Observed System Components
- SPV-A-0001 — Solar Panel Array (4 panels)
- INV-01 — Power Inverter (DC to AC conversion)
- PWR-BAT-0001 / PWR-BAT-0002 — Energy Storage Units

## System Role
The inverter converts DC power from the solar panel array into AC power
for farm operations, including pumps, lighting, kitchen, and network systems.

## Operational Status
- Solar Panels: Active
- Inverter: Active
- Storage Units: Active

## Related Data Units
- DU-00825
- DU-00826

## Verification
This record captures a real-world system labeling event intended to
improve auditability, system clarity, and long-term infrastructure traceability
within the DGCP framework.
