Time (Local): 07:15  
Timezone: Asia/Bangkok  

Project: MaMeeFarm™  
Framework: DGCP™  
Proof ID: 584  

## Evidence Description
This proof documents the observed condition of a soil canal in Zone FZ-04.
The canal shows dryness and limited water retention despite prior water inflow.
The soil structure appears unable to retain water effectively at the time of capture.

## Location
Zone: FZ-04  
Area Type: Soil water retention canal  

## Reference
- Related Data Unit: 00890 (previous record showing standing water condition)
